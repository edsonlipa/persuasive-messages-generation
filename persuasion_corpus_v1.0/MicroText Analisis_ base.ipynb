world and it just things went down different then they were suppose to i just i dont what happened preparations for a long time', 'where youre at now was preperations for a long time', 'oh yea it just all went down the wrong way', 'no not at all our plan was much different than this', 'ive accomplished absolutely nothing', 'dont give me that bull fighter for the cause they think im a mad man [laughs]', 'i disagree with that', 'well i know what theyll probably portray me as and thats their problem i wont be here to have to deal with it', 'but what they portray you as and what people perceive you as are completely different things', 'well it it [sighs]', 'but chaos is a solution the random factors of the solution', 'but chaos only works when theres leadership', 'no chaos works without leaders thats why its chaotic thats why it cant be traced the anonymous act cannot be traced', 'but theres no direction no uh', 'there need no be if everyone is a leader', 'but its constant chaos at that point you need', 'thats the idea', 'but in effect how does that help the people', 'it uses up the system', 'well i guess thats one [inaudible]', 'it will be used up my life will be used but it will continue on it will be used up and if theres a here after ill be wating', 'are there people here that you deal with all the time that know what youre goals are and', 'i would be a fool to

that far', 'well theres one other person that i probably doesnt not even want me to mention his name who is a relative of mine <name>', 'really', 'yea but he probably wants no part of me right now [laughs]', 'how close a relative is he', 'he married my cousin', 'have you uh been together before', 'oh yea weve had walks and such but i dont think he wants any part of me right now', 'well', 'i would trust him', 'what could we do i mean you trust him to what degree', 'to bring my dog to me', 'i told you i intend to terminate myself', 'well i think all of those people would feel the same as i do that', 'look i had all of those people here last night if i intended there were people walking down the street if i intended to just randomly waste people i could have easily that was not my purpose', 'well uh uh', 'would you', 'i would go in if someone had gave me their word and i knew that they had been consistent in the past i was consistent', 'well thats only one time i dont think you can really say thats consistency', 'its consistent enough', '[laughs] are you do you thing i am totally crazy giving up the weapons i have nothing i cant even terminate myself', 'i still think that we should look at this as where were gonna go with the future not where were gonna end theres a lot to the future', 'im going into the dirt i would like my dog to go with me', 'that kind of a position well nobody knows who you are', 'well i dont intend to hurt anyone except myself and i dont intend to hurt my dog other than i know he will only be loyal to me and nobody else will care for him like i have', 'i have', 'now youll have to figure that one out', 'well', 'i have enough believe me i could rip this place apart', 'well if they want to come in and try to take me thats fine im im gonna do

'it just doesnt work', 'wait now lets get that straight right now', 'well you tried to con on <name> not being dead i know shes dead', 'well they gave you false information', 'i cant be assured of anything anything that you ask me ill try and accomplish', 'well see thats what i mean nobody can be assured of', 'i cant trust anybody right now', 'all i can do is trust myself', 'well youre gonna have to trust somebody else', 'id like to trust someone to bring my dog to me', 'well i told you i intend to die and uh i will i will not hurt anyone that brings the dog to me', 'well', 'well hes gonna be the same way when i go to the funny farm or where ever they wanna take me to', 'but at least you can make some arrangements that you think are are necessary', 'what do you think you think i should just shoot myself or you guys wanna come in and try to take me', 'i dont think we should go in either direction i think we oughtta discuss you comin out and [inaudible]', 'thats insane', '[sighs]', 'im going right [phone_drops_to_floor]', 'hello', 'hi', 'hi', 'this is henry', 'okay henry you want to speak to david', 'yes who is this', 'its rita again', 'thank you rita', 'okay', 'wait a minute had this ear plug again', 'what', 'i said i had the ear plug in again', 'oh okay', 'i keep putting the phone with the ear plug', 'oh okay', 'okay heres the deal', 'okay', 'im going to make this tape now you know some of these younger girls you know they dont want to go you know and i i explained to them i said look i says you know our main thing sarah knows anyway and its the truth you know the truth you know', 'um hum', 'and i explained to them again cause you know they the girls have the different rooms and talked to them but i explained to them i said you know our whole purpose is our message we have a message and the worlds ignorant of what we believe in the bible so theyre ignorant about what were doing', 'um hum', 'you know', 'see thats what they anyway im sorry i didnt mean to get off the track', 'okay', 'heres the deal so some of the some of the older you know we have quite a few older ladies here too', 'okay', 'and i told them i said look i says you know you all you know you all cause they theyve been quite shocked you know i told him i said look you all you all are not really involved in anything you know you all believe the message and believe the truth i says but remember thats the main thing is the truth is what we all stand for', 'okay', 'and i says you can probably also help present to the people the truth', 'um hum', 'and so you know ive ive been talking to them i said look heres the deal you know you can either witness for god here and probably dont want to listen to us or if you had a chance to to be on the outside you could witness to him there', 'um hum', 'you know cause people are going to want to know why weve done these crazy things now next thing we didnt give them a bunch of baloney but i said you know youre the ones that are supposed to be the victims so you know if youre out there you can do a greater witness for god you know being out there to show them that you do want to live cause you know a dead christian is a dead christian', 'right', 'a live christian is a witness', 'um hum', 'so you know and so i explained to them you know if if if you all can you know realize that see the thing of it is we dont teach that america has to be punished we teach that god grants unto men an opportunity to see his mistake in the light of gods word and then repent of it', 'um hum', 'you know and so thats the whole thing so this this is where me and jim had a good relationship on the phone because you know i began to explain things to him he like you is an excellent listener and he began to realize that were not trying to be just radical idiots you know with ragging our head off you know talking about armegeddon and stuff', 'um hum', 'you know armegeddon is the prophecies tell you is an end of time when god resurrects all the people that have ever lived and they attack the city of god ezekial talks about it so you know anyway its not a few handsful of maniacs trying to fight thats not armegeddon at all', 'okay', 'but anyway so the thing of it is is that you know theres theres you know theres three of them here that are you know deciding on you know whether you know they want to go or not', 'okay', 'and so im talking to them a bit more now but so it appears to be like i say i told them what what you promised to do for us you know for us which is for god right', 'um hum', 'because youre doing it for our god', 'um hum', 'you know for our belief in god', 'um hum', 'and and so therefore you know this is the whole reason for the truth anyway is to is to be able to have what we believe known', 'okay', 'these people can decide better and then you can ask us questions if were alive', 'right', 'and if were gone then you know no no good i agree with you guys you know two children thats the thats the main thing and two two of the women here', 'okay now thats now remember theyre doing theyre doing this', 'i understand', 'no we will but you know that thatll start thatll start the ball rolling and well both reach our goals okay', 'okay well ill', 'now', 'ill tell them that', 'okay now what i want to do is i want to to get your tape as soon as i can one of the things that were considering because a lot in terms of radio prime time is when the commute is on okay', 'the what now', 'when the commuters are driving to work is when prime time is on radioland okay so youre working on the tape and should have it for me soon is that correct', 'well if i if i get a chance to keep making it', 'okay', 'but prime time i thought was the time the people are driving home when they get home in the evening', 'well', 'thats prime time', 'radio i think is is when everybody is going to work dont you think i mean thats when everybody really listens to the radio', 'well thats thats not really ask ask the producers and theyll tell you opposite but anyway like i said youll be playing the dallas one first right', 'were going to play dallas and then we hope to go to national right away', 'okay now cause im sure like you say the subject matterll be intense enough especially if radio stations could broadcast that its coming', 'exactly', 'you know and then that way you know yeah we could like you said and arizona will be from 11 to 1 or something right', 'um hum but', 'okay thats good', 'but we want to go on this right away were not going to wait till 11 oclock', 'oh no with the tape the tape needs to be given to you as early as possible', 'yes and as soon as we do that were going to go national well go on krld and and then after that well go national', 'all right and the national will be 11 oclock right', 'itll be as soon as as right after krld plays it', 'well how can that be then i mean how are you going to be able to get the tape to to arizona', 'well were everybody or a lot of a lot of the national radio stations are here you know in this general area so were going to find somebody you know thats a national radio', 'i see so youre not going to be playing it around 11 or 12 then', 'were going to play it at 11 and 12 oclock too but you know but you know', 'well you know if thats', 'well i told', 'yeah i', 'okay so like i say i could more than i could more than last im sure till 12 oclock itll be our time right', 'okay okay well', 'like i say thats when well come all out', 'okay well thats fine', 'were going to were going to like i say once i

women for you and two children', 'okay', 'okay', 'thats fine', 'are we are we in tune', 'were in tune', 'okay thanks henry', 'thank you', 'god bless you now well talk to you later okay', 'okay ill

perimeter of the area remember we talked about that earlier', 'arent there already three here or something', 'well those those are the ones that we talked about but they have never been they have

try to do is wed like to try to continue bringing kids out and any other people that are ready to come out', 'okay so theyd like to continue bringing the kids out and any others that want to come out hes talking to the brass i dont know about what [unidentified_voice_in_background_not_discernible]', 'he wants jim to give him a call as soon as the van is here i guess', 'okay is jake i have jake here or jacob', 'okay', 'who would jacob be talking to', 'who would jake be talking to he has jake there of course and little brian [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible]', 'jake', 'this is henry who is this', 'can i have jake please', 'yes you certainly may hold on just a second', 'hi', 'hi i love you i love you tell brian okay tell brian i love him okay ive got to go put the other guy back on the phone i love you tell me tell me you love me', 'bye', 'bye', 'hello', 'put the guy back on the phone', 'huh', 'okay', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'henry', 'yes', 'so is jim

david is hoping that you know to try', 'okay thats fine well work it right now', 'all right', 'are you are you ready to send them right now', 'well id like to can i talk to him for just a second', 'okay he wants to talk to you', 'hello', 'how are you doing', 'kind of weak how are you boys doing', 'how do you feel now', 'how do i feel now', 'um hum', 'just a little pain', 'well like i was telling jim you know i told jim to to look into that bible i told him to look into revelation 4 and 5 i told him to look into those seals now if you look at the the fifth seal if you look at the sixth seal if you look into isaiah 13 if you look in joel 2 if you look into the back of nahum whats fixing to happen has already been foretold i teach seven seals now whatever that means you know id like to talk with you guys in full id like you to grab a bible sit down and follow me word by word see what the ancients have foresaw and that way wed have a better understanding but i realize that you know most of you are not ready for that youve got your own way of doing things', 'look', 'oh im definitely a family person', 'look henry', 'youre not going to listen to me are you', 'i will listen to you', 'okay youre listening now', 'yes i am', 'okay the event that youre now fixing to witness is youre fixing to see a government a government thats been blessed see there was an ancient empire called babylon', 'um hum', 'land of the chaldeans and before babylon ruled the then known world god had a people that he brought out of egypt and god had given them laws and statutes and god had stated unto israel which was a cult because they had one leader moses and one right hand man aaron and god says and promised that if they will keep his laws hell make them the head of all nations if they break his laws hell scatter them amongst the nations and the nations of the heathens will rule over them so for many many hundreds of years god forebores his people but finally the days came when israel became worse than the heathens so god arose prophets such as isaiah hosea obadiah malachi zephaniah habakkuk you know these prophets nahum and god foretold in these prophets how that theyd be scattered amongst the nations in the book of daniel daniel was shown while under the chaldean captivity he was shown that the nations of the earth that shall rule over gods people will be symbolized as one great image and the image will be head of gold arms of silver belly of brass legs of iron feet part of iron and part of clay and daniel says to the king nebuchadnezzar the highest ruling position of the land in that day daniel says thou oh king of this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and yet a third kingdom of brass and then a fourth kingdom dreadful and terrible it shall cometh the whole world', 'um hum', 'and then there shall be a kingdom that shall be at the ten toes partly strong and partly broken so when rome split up under the nomadic kingdoms it fell into many different kingdoms', 'um hum', 'we know it as europe now daniel goes on to explain that while europe is still in existence he goes on to say [indiscernible] behold a stone came and smote the image in the feet and they had gold and silver and brass and iron was all made as the chaff of the summer threshing floors well this stone is the subject of which the book of revelation talks about it talks about that which must be hereafter that god will one day in the future in the end of the world shall come and sit on his throne in heaven and therell be one question asked in heaven the question is who is worthy to open this book the book is in the right hand of god and to lose these seven seals thereof scripture clearly teaches christendom that no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open and he looked thereon', 'um hum', 'but the lamb the lamb is symbolized as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns you know god creates things in seven days doesnt he', 'um hum', 'okay theres only one many who knows what that book teaches but for the sake of humanity the acid test revolving around the subjects in this book revolve around christ in heaven opening the seals and what is witnessed is a man on a white horse a man on a red horse black and pale dead souls under the altar described to god because of their blood thats been shed and then the time when the sun and moon and stars will be darkened the heavens will part as a scroll and the great man mighty men free men bonded men shall cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb but the great davids wrath has come', 'um hum', 'so these subjects are mysteries cause nobody really has a real thorough opinion to really know the real meanings of these things but in chapter 10 after the student of scripture is read and become familiar with the symbols in chapter 10 after talking about an army of 200 million that overthrow the world it talks about a mighty angel coming down from heaven and he has in his hand a little book and its opened and seven thunders are uttered seven thunders and john was told that when theres time no longer this mystery of god this revelation of jesus christ the seven seals will be finished as god has declared to his servants the prophets', 'um hum', 'so in this 22nd chapter after a person takes the time to read these things its very clear the statement christ says i jesus have sent my angel to testify to these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david now ancient david was a great king wasnt he', 'um hum', 'hes the one that took his little sling stone and slew the great giant goliath', 'right', 'yeah okay so what happened was he says behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give it to every man according as his work shall be', 'um hum', 'now when christ comes the question is going to be what did the father give him that no other man in heaven was worthy to receive no man was worthy a book right', 'um hum', 'god gave him a book a revelation of himself that the father claims hes the author of this book and when the lamb comes hes going to bring this book and mankind is supposed to find out that it is the bible the bible which the prophets of god having spoken by the spirit that god gave them having volumed a testament in regards to those events that must be fulfilled in the latter days now in revelation 13 john witnesses in regards to the seventh seal john sees a beast this beast has a head like a lion a body like a leopard feet of a bear in daniel 7 daniel foretold that the empires of babylon persia greece and rome would be symbolized babylon as a lion persia as a bear greece as a leopard and the fourth beast he said would devour all the three beasts before it and conquer the world now that was rome daniel also says in the days of this kingdom they will kill the prince of the covenant they could change gods times and gods laws and place abomination to make desolate false religion we know the only true religion is the religion of god', 'um hum', 'now christ died during the times of rome and on the cross very clearly its written in the gospel records he said father forgive them for they know not what they do', 'um hum', 'and then he said into thy hand i commit my spirit and the hand of god has a book the word by the word of god god made heaven and earth and by his word there was prophets the events that youre now witnessing are taking place now what is taking place well in the book of micah it says in that day they shall gather together and they shall say let thine be defiled that they know not the thoughts of the lord neither do they understand his counsel all of the prophets through the book of nahum it talks about messiah it talks about well for instance to make it real simple christ says he has the key of david in revelation so in the book of the psalms for instance psalms 2 david sees a vision of the future of a confrontation between man and mans law', 'um hum', 'and god and gods law', 'um hum', 'now revelation 13 tells us that theres a lamb like beast thatll rise up having two horns and itll speak as a dragon now weve got to identify what great empire arose up after europe thats a great empire thats lamb like or christian but yet doesnt really tell the truth well the only great empire weve known is the united states of america now back to psalms 2 the psalm says why do the heathen rage you know the heathen dont know god', 'um hum', 'they dont know his word', 'um hum', 'and they get angry', 'um hum', 'it says and the people imagine vain things for the leaders of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the lord', 'um hum', 'and against his anointed', 'um hum', 'thats christ you see', 'um hum', 'saying let us break his bands asunder now what are the seven bands that christ promises to bring when he comes again the seven seals right', 'um hum', 'but zachariah and the other prophets say that the world will not regard these messages of mercy they have no interest in being instructed by anyone but themselves now they say let us break his bands asunder let us cast his cords away from us but scripture says which is taking place right now it says that he that sits in the heavens thats the father you see', 'um hum', 'shall laugh for the lord shall have them the heathen in confusion see the heathen dont know what theyre doing and this time they cant be forgiven because this time they willfully reject the subject which so plainly has been laid in the book of revelation a subject which everyone is to be very familiarized with for the latter days and yet theyre to understand by earnest study that these things will remain a mystery until christ comes again', 'um hum', 'to reveal these mysteries', 'um hum', 'so the heathen and their tactics in dealing with a person based upon rumors and based upon their laws they fail to understand that god also has a law and god also has a kingdom and god also has a key so what takes place it says then shall the lord speak unto them in his wrath thats what happens during the sixth seal', 'um hum', 'the sun and moon and stars is darkened the heaven departs as a scroll and the great men of the earth cry to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the reality that they would not know aforetime what god said will be so they end up fulfilling prophecy not knowing what side theyre doing but to the wise when god speaks in his wrath they already know of the events and it says yet have i set my king up on my holy hill of zion so irrespective of what attitude the heathen may take against the truth of the seven seals or the man that is trying to teach the seven seals irrespective gods kingdom the stone god himself is going to intervene and hes going to hit the image in the feet and its all going to blow away and gods going to take the jurisdiction and power from all the great men of the earth and all that the prophets have spoken is to be fulfilled', 'um hum', 'now the psalm continues to say i will declare the decree the lord has said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee so we know the anointed one is christ dont we christ is the son of god in psalms 2 right', 'um hum', 'and it says the father says to the son ask of me and i will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the earth for thy possession for thou shalt dash the heathen to pieces with a rod of iron and shall break them as a potters vessel now thats pretty bad isnt it', 'um hum', 'i mean nobody wants to be hurt do they', 'no really', 'so thats why in psalms 2 the subject is clear the mission of the lamb the anointed one is to teach the seals okay', 'um hum', 'now the reason why the prophecy is written is because it continues to say now therefore be wise ye rulers of the world be instructed ye judges of the earth serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the son least he be angry and ye perish in the way when is wrath is kindled but a little now im not mad at you guys you know', 'well and were not mad at you either', 'well but your show of arms is definitely bigger than my show of arms so in psalms 18 the psalm has made very plain when it says i will love the lord for he is my rock and my salvation my buckler and the horn of my salvation it says i will call upon him so shall i be delivered from my enemies for they were too strong for me and the day of my calamity and this is a calamity really they prevented me and then it goes on to talk about a terrible event that takes place afterwards because you know you all guys are too big for me you know your laws are more numerous than the ten commandments you know your weapons are bigger your forces are stronger', 'um hum', 'you know but not really you see not really you know elijah in his day the king of israel was having to face the moabites and the hittites and they were outnumbered but what elijah said was they that be with us are more than they that be with them because unbeknown to the forces of the heathen who were so boistering of their superior power they did not see the invisible forces of god the angels of god you know just like in the days of ancient hezekiah', 'um hum', 'when the assyrian armies came into judea they kept saying to hezekiah now do not deceive your people but have all of them come out to me and well take you to a land likened to your own and the land flow with milk and honey dont let hezekiah deceive you saying that your god will deliver you anyway what happened was as hezekiah had listened to the prophet isaiah hezekiah had repented his sins asking god for forgiveness and hezekiah prayed to god saying lord god of heaven thou art the only true and living god and all the gods of the earth are idols and they are no gods now weve come to the birth and theres no strength to bring forth so please save us and deliver us that all the world may know that there is a true and living god is israel so what took place was is that that night the angel of the lord went forth and smote 185 000 of their warriors and they perished you see we all know christ is coming soon', 'um hum', 'that gospels been preached for a long time hasnt it', 'um hum it certainly has', 'yes and everyone is supposed to be like christ arent they', 'right', 'okay but the question is is the world ready for the coming of christ in glory well god never said he would come in glory the second time the scriptures tell us as the gospel of peter tells us look for the salvation that shall be brought to you in the end of the world at the revelation of jesus christ we find in hebrews paul tries to explain to the christian church that we who are of the spirit dwell in the heavenly sanctuary a sanctuary where the man of this world can never contaminate they cannot pollute it they cannot contaminate it because it revolves around god who speaks through his word the seven seals and you know like i say unless we fear god unless we fear his word', 'um hum', 'you know the appearance of the thing just like 2 000 years ago who really believed that christ was messiah', 'thats right', 'you know', 'thats right', 'and why did he have to die he says father i pleadeth that thy remove this cup from me but if it be not removed except i drink it not my will but they will be done taken from psalm 60 where it says lord thou has shown thy people hard things well the seven seals are pretty hard things thou has made us to drink the wine of astonishment psalm 75 messiah is talking to the to the heathen and he says i said to the fools do not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for know that promotion comes neither from the east nor the west nor the south by the north in orion past orion in heaven in the northern part of the universe the father has exalted and promoted christ above all heaven hasnt he', 'um hum', 'right okay it says in psalm 75 were having a lot of babies crying around here now', 'are they okay', 'i guess theyre why are the babies crying so much [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] yeah can you give them some bottle or some some breast or something [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] please yeah she wants some milk okay anyway so were stuck in a corner right now my friend', 'how do you feel right now', 'well', 'physically', 'in psalms i dont know its like this christ says he has the key of david right', 'um hum', 'he can open and no one can shut', 'um hum', 'its taken from the prophecy of isaiah 22 for god promises to overthrow the ungodly of his land hes going to take away the power of the ungodly and reestablish his kingdom', 'uh huh', 'he says in that day ill rise up my servant yeah he says eliakim which means godll raise up eliakim it says on that day ill lay upon his shoulder the key of david and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and it says they shall lay upon him all the glory of his fathers house now unless you know who eliakim is you wont know who his father is but it says you shall lay upon him the offspring and the issue but you know what that is thats children isnt it offspring', 'um hum', 'yeah well thats where you get the first seal at the man on the white horse the first thing that i try to teach people in psalms in the first seal you know the man on the white horse is that youve got a bow right', 'um hum', 'and hes also got a crown right', 'um hum', 'he goes forth conquering and to conquer right', 'um hum', 'well then what happens is you find the truth of that in the 45th psalm [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] theyre on the roof with ropes', 'what', 'theyre on the roof with ropes right now', 'no no', 'the guys are seeing them right', 'no theyre on the roof with ropes', 'no no thats not possible', 'theyre right up there', 'steve like i say i feel so sorry for you guys', 'what we want what were hoping to do', 'i know what you want but you dont understand look at how much look did jim jones ever get this kind of slander look', 'we dont want anybody we certainly dont want you to be slandered', 'listen let me explain again', 'okay', 'okay look in psalms 45 gods the one speaking and when you come up hither to my church see its the spirit and the world the world is bad there is no temple on god to be honest the temple of god must be in you and it must be in truth spirit and in truth okay when you come up hither youll see god on a throne thats whats written isnt it when you read things you dont really see

that were trying to obtain freedom because of european oppression right', 'um hum', 'remember how this government did to the indians', 'right', 'you know i mean its sometimes its really a real picture of attitude to really identify what is really right and whats really wrong but thats where the point of reasoning comes in', 'right', 'and thats what we try to establish here is', 'hey youve been', 'let us reason together the scripture says', 'well this is the way i always try to teach the scriptures too then people jump around and say that im crazy now in that tape that i made over for the

you sent you know this is what theyre saying now im not saying that thats true', 'okay', 'see so youre being if youre honest and youre being dirty dealt with just like i have been dirty dealt with you see and its a different situation but still its the same thing', 'well', 'theyre saying that youre going to do something and its going on national radio state radio at least and people are out there listening and youre not correcting it you know and theyre saying well the fog is a good cover and this is going to happen and and weve seen these many vehicles and theyre moving up and and you know well youre not youre not getting on those boys saying now wait a minute you know were not doing that no theyre theyre incessantly tormenting us you know and theyre telling us what you guys are doing', 'exactly but one of the things that weve been doing is weve been ignoring the press because we dont want the press to know what we are or are not doing you know and thats why we havent said anything one way or the other', 'all right', 'thats why the press doesnt have the correct story because were just', 'but the press', 'not talking to them', 'the press you know you all pulled them back because you know they feel that when you all come in here and and bang us all up and everything that you dont want them to get it on footage', 'yeah thats true', 'and thats in your favor i agree', 'okay', 'okay', 'you know', 'okay lets do this', 'see there were', 'look look theres one thing that binds us all here together', 'um hum', 'um hum', 'to barter someone elses decision to deal with the effects of what we have believed in because you all fail to understand what were believing in the constitution watch the baby please in in written form though theres many interpretations constitutional law says that we are to have religious freedom for religion but of course it has quotas to where weve got to define what religion is and is not acceptable', 'um hum', 'okay now we do condone a bible religion but then there comes in the aspect of interpretation so someones interpretation could be wrong and therefore making their religion wrong and if that religion hurts others if it confines others or binds others then definitely we have to take a stand and present it to the public so that the public which is our judicial system realistically can decide that well no this is incorrect and we have to in means deal with the person thats going contrary to to what the person is saying the scripture says you know people can screw things up and that religion is a false religion for sure', 'um hum', 'um hum', 'now thats when i had to stop and think now what does he know that i dont know i didnt know donny joe harvey or orville wells yet i didnt know that george was involved in coke and also in methamphetamine i didnt know those things then', 'um hum', 'so you know why the system did not well like i say this is a lot of water under a bridge', 'right', 'but it did make me look bad and the thing of it was was that the weapons that we purchased which you can look on all the yellow sheets at that time everything we had was with a yellow sheet', 'um hum', 'everything we bought was with a yellow sheet everything youll find that those things were bought locally and also in from palestine there were basic rugers you know and stuff which at that time was considered you know a rodent gun you know', 'um hum', 'of course we know that the 5 56 is also a military too', 'right', 'but anyway the thing of it is is that it gets blown out of proportion', 'right and i think one of the things that were talking about and what were trying to resolve here is is that everybodys either fears or concerns about what might or might not happen i i think that what your concern is your main concern is that we might attack you okay and', 'well if you attack us it just comes down to this', 'okay but were not we have no intentions of doing that', 'i know but it just comes down to this though you end up killing us', 'okay and our concern is that that', 'and then youll have a story the way you had it youll theres no theres no media around us', 'well we dont', 'youll say that we attacked you and this that', 'no our concern is that youre not going to come out and that you might commit suicide', 'well', 'um hum', 'you know [indiscernible] we will not be careful in answering this to you king we will not bow down to your law which goes against our gods law well the acid test came they threw those boys in the fire didnt they', 'um hum', 'but who protected them god did now were in the fire now not a real fire and like i say we believe that america is a great nation and that it like assyria or nineva of old can hear the message of jonah and it can have a chance to say hey you know this this what this guys teaching out of the book is straight out of the bible its in harmony its perfect maybe theres been a misunderstanding here', 'well what if we can go back and clarify our agreement so that you feel comfortable', 'right', 'let me let me talk about this with with some', 'no no come on', 'come on', 'look', 'oh henry', 'um hum', 'how many times has the federal government', 'im just thinking about all the past cases of where the like i say we both know what im talking about', 'whatever past cases ive had', 'but this is our case this is our case me and you are talking and', 'exactly exactly this is you and me', 'okay', 'and and', 'so youre worried about me committing suicide all right', 'we dont want anybody committing suicide', 'okay', 'well how cold is it in this room', 'i understand that', 'low forties', 'yeah', 'well', 'thats what we were working out now youre twisting up again', 'no im not', 'we will and thats exact', 'and i told you', 'thats exactly what were going to do', 'okay let me like i said finishing this tape is being dragged out now too so', 'okay', 'let me ill have to ill have to get with these you know especially some of these girls and talk to them', 'well as soon as i get my tape finished', 'im not you know im just asking you if you will consider doing that', 'okay', 'you know and like i say these people know the seals and they know that unless this country observes and sees then they know point blank whats going to happen according to the prophecies thats why our main burden is holding out here until we have an opportunity to state our cause you know what did nicodemus say he says did our law judge any many before the hearing were talking about the jewish law which is law of god now we know the law of man does but you know thats where me and you we kind of kind of have a little friction because i want to serve your laws where they coincide with gods laws and america does above all of the nations it does you know its the closest to gods laws basic principles of common sense you know but again there are some laws in the scriptures of truth which are the laws of prophecy you know and these laws are great laws because theyre additional to the ten commandment law such as the law of forgive them father they dont know what they do', 'um hum', 'see now thats a law you have to forgive people based on their ignorance', 'okay', 'now the next law which lets say the ten commandments is christ right', 'um hum', 'so the 11th commandment is forgive them okay so every man that that does err we have to forgive him cause they dont know what theyre doing', 'um hum', 'so then the 12th law will be into they hand i commit my spirit which means like isaiah 51 says when god says hearken to me you who seek after righteousness you who seek the lord look to the rock [indiscernible] you know god is that rock on that throne isnt he', 'um hum', 'and it says behold my people give ear to me oh my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light to the people and in that judgment that law is christ coming the seventh seal', 'um hum', 'now thats why without you knowing where these seven seals are in the bible you know you wouldnt know how to judge me', 'exactly', 'except by your law and i respect that see im willing to come out and be observed and judged by your', 'okay', 'law', 'okay', 'but if you allow me to first speak my law', 'okay', 'okay whats the preamble', 'thats thats where youre going to explain our agreement to the', 'oh okay right okay', 'okay', 'right all right', 'okay so ill call you back in a little bit', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay im going to have to do some adjustment here now so', 'okay', 'okay ill talk to you in a little bit', 'okay ill talk to you

serious', 'exactly', 'number two that has national exposure', 'okay', 'now the you know as you know that one of one of the concerns that i have is here you are very serious okay and some of these people are calling you i dont even want to tell you what theyre calling you okay i mean its something that you dont like okay so i thought it would be', 'no okay i just i got what youre saying just', 'okay so we want to have something that you know that youre going to be pleased with because its considered a serious religious network okay so we i mean we called this national network in arizona and we couldnt get a hold of anybody so what we did is we called our fbi office in phoenix and as we speak theyre waking up the people that are in charge of this', 'its not a 24 hour radio station', 'well im not sure about that im sure that it is', 'what what', 'i shouldnt say im sure that it is but but the people that we were trying to contact the head people werent around so', 'oh i see yeah', 'so

long one', 'okay', 'and were going to put something together very tangible very simple very even and begin to show the difference between the way i perceive the seals and what in in difference to what weve heard the seals being presented thus far by all so called teachers and religious leaders that have been calling the radio stations', 'uh huh', 'so that way people will be able to honestly listen and read their bibles as theyre listening and see that i know what im talking about', 'exactly', 'and then theyll make a decision from what they themselves have seen and heard from their own bible and then like i say then im in your hands', 'okay one of the concerns that i have okay is im talking to some people some medical people and what i dont like what im hearing and what im hearing is that you know remember when we were talking earlier and you coughed okay you told me that you thought that you might be bleeding if you', 'yeah when i cough i bleed', 'okay now do you do you think that youre bleeding internally probably right', 'well the hole is right here next to the belly and it it hit me in the the pelvic and then it somehow traced around and went out kind of towards my back there was a hole in the back', '[whispering] my god', 'that was bigger than the hole in the front', 'yeah well see', 'and then the', 'well i was in shock when i first got hit i thought', 'okay', 'but like i say

if you have or if youre not happy with the national christian broadcasting network we can go to krld i mean i dont have any problems going with whomever you want', 'well thats like i say if its a national coverage then other stations will pick it up', 'sure', 'and krld will probably more than happy want to play it because theyve theyve been wondering whats happened to me anyway', 'okay well i dont have any problems making them a copy and giving them a copy or whatever youd like', 'would you would you make a correction for krld and then those things for me', 'okay', 'lets see they keep

little higher than what my voice is but', 'okay', 'this is a small speaker can you hear that [playing_following_from_tape] last living disciples on the isle of patmos being a prisoner for the word of

say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on a lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia which we do see clearly in the scriptures', 'david', 'yeah', 'that sounds pretty good', 'like i say its the the way you know if youll hear between it kind of breaths and pushes', 'um hum', 'and i tried to make that you know like i say i tried to make it as clear as possible', 'okay', 'so you know thats thats why i was you know but what i did was is if we got a couple of the guys and they kind of they kind of pulled me up a bit we put the what do you call this cushion scott', 'its a foam [indiscernible]', 'a foam yeah to where i could kind of sit up a little bit and im kind of about at a 45 degree i dont know any anyway so i just like tried to take a short

exactly were going to do with in terms of the tape you know as i said you know what wed like to do is wed like to go ahead and and play it okay now', 'well what we well this morning when we send we send two more children out with you', 'um hum', 'theyre going to bring the tape with them okay', 'okay', 'okay', 'and of course i guess you well whats the visibility out there now scott',

know because you know mothers and the remaining children you know you know its kind of cold so you know they are going to have to have coats on but', 'okay', 'i just want you to see that theyre not bearing any arms', 'okay', 'and like i say they can go out that way because some like have two children some have three children', 'okay', 'you know and then you know ill space them at a long enough distance to where and you can see theres a steady line of them and', 'okay', 'ill have them walk up to the to the front of the property there at the gate then the guys will come out and ill have them hold their hands up', 'okay and single file', 'and okay like yeah single file not two at a time', 'um hum', 'their hands up and and well do you have like', 'we can turn', 'warm vehicles and stuff like that', 'what well do is well well turn on the lights and they can walk towards the lights and then well have people you know ready to to assist them once they get to to the cars', 'all right now whens this now whens this tape going to be played again', 'like i said lets still do the children thing', 'okay', 'well we', 'i do', 'we want to play it as soon as we can so we can get everybody out', 'well we', 'so people can hear it', 'we can do that and absolutely we will do that', 'okay then all right then but we', 'but we want but we want we want to start getting this thing you know we want to try to bring this', 'im aware i realize', 'im not no', 'no i want this to i want', 'if we take a look at the record of john the gospel writer john take chapter 7 we see in scripture john writes that after certain events after these things jesus walked in galilee he would not walk openly he would not walk in jewry would not walk amongst the jews because the jews sought to kill him we might wonder why wasnt christ such a good man now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that they disciples also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if though do these things shew thyself to the world for neither did his brethren believe in him strange statement isnt it its funny how that when men live and have to deal with realities of life that even a man like christ could have to meet with unbelief even from his own brethren then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready and im sure most fellow bible students will agree the time referred to is the time of his crucifixion they wanted to kill him and he didnt want to show himself openly then jesus said to unto them excuse me verse 7 the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret you would wonder why a man like christ would have something to hide i mean surely the angels would protect him obviously i personally think a lot of things about this strange character and disposition of character but were sure in being christian that christ knew what he was doing [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he', 'well can you let them find out if they see the stretcher if they took the stretcher out', 'and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people', 'the truck is here but were waiting to see if they let out the stretcher are you there', 'yeah', 'okay', 'howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews', 'what did you say about the stretcher', 'now we understand the jews at that time had their own religious [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible]', 'oh', 'political network didnt they', 'okay well were sending it', 'and a pretty strongly religious spectrum although they had no actual political power they were subject to the relevant government and thus to the really traditional rabbinical laws now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught and jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned now in the days of israel most scholars and teachers will agree that the schools of israel ordained by the sanhedrin and also the pharisees were schools similar to the ones of our own theological schools of today of which a careful student of scripture observes that no where is it written in the gospel that christ ever attended these schools but at the age of 12 he did enter into the temple and had a most unique and interesting discussion with the religious leaders of which they were quite amazed at such a young lads knowledge of scripture now this man was teaching something no doubt christ that is that inspired the people to say you know how knoweth this man you know letters having never learned they marvelled jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me now what does that mean my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me', 'returning to [indiscernible]', 'if any man will do the will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself now friends people that love the lord this is where we begin to talk about some serious things im sure youre all aware of how how im involved in a very serious thing right now and im sure that a lot of you realize that i should be possibly scared concerned there is women children and men involved in our situation here at mt carmel but i am really concerned about the lies of my brethren here and also really concerned even greater about the lies of all those in this world you know without christ without jesus we have no hope why well because we know that the standard of gods righteousness is a law a law between men a law of statutes and judgments and which god gave unto moses from sinai say this is thy righteousness o israel but you know god also gave another law a law revolving around a system of shedding a poor and innocent lambs blood and that all who would break the law of god who

real good', 'ive already cleared go ahead', 'okay thanks', 'okay', 'okay bye bye', 'okay', 'rachel', 'yes', 'okay is david still listening to the message', 'yes', 'okay all right just hang on here with me', 'okay', 'for they know not what they do [indiscernible] which is a point that were fixing to get into quite heavily father into thy hands i commit my spirit taken from psalms 31 we begin to see that christ is well versed at the scripture just like the gospels tell him when [indiscernible] always referring i guess to temptation by stating it is written it is written it is written now what is this spirit of christ well they pierced his side out of his side came blood and water i get another mystery this became something to do with eating his body and drinking his blood some implements for the church but what do these things really mean well after weve read acts and learned of the power of pentecost the cloven tongues of fire that came upon the apostles who by mercy through christ were given another chance to recover from their falling we learn through romans that there is a righteousness of god in christ declare his righteousness we learn in corinthians i and ii we learn in ephesians galatians philippians oh we have such a wealth of information of such intelligent men who speak sometimes very deep mystical things about a god who is in the form of humanity who is the son of god who sits at the right hand of god in the highest court of the universe', 'keep the kids quiet', 'who promises that one day hell come again well the last living apostle [indiscernible] this great controversy and i might add those who persecuted christ who would not hear him no matter what sign was given also persecuted his disciples and finally we end up in the book of revelation where john the last living disciple on the isle of patmos being a prisoner for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ which no doubt are the things jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the pharisees and sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on the lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia of which we can see clearly in the scriptures that they were given specific and direct messages from christ and in each one of these messages christ specifically told the churches what he would have them to do now we know that christ is the only man in scripture who ever kept the law of god perfectly we know that because weve heard the writings of the apostles but sad to say the religious leaders of his days and the majority of the populace of his days didnt think so its funny how that is its kind of like people always like to build the sepulchers of the dead prophets and garnish their tombs but yet they hate and kill the living prophets only god knows why that is but nonetheless the church of ephesus smyrna thyatira sardis philadelphia laodicea the churches thats involved for anyone to read direct counsel is given beginning with its the age of the church of ephesus right these things [indiscernible] what happens if the best is given and then the decision is up to those [indiscernible] christ each council [indiscernible] even has ear to hear so if you want to know but in here with the spirit [indiscernible] the church finally we get to the 40th chapter of revelation', 'they picked up the stretcher now theyre on their way back', 'and as soon as scripture becomes [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]', 'they picked it up you said', 'yeah', 'and theyre on', 'now theyre on their way back', 'okay okay good can you see them', 'yeah', 'which was referring to the last part of third chapter of the message of laodicea he says after these things i saw and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice that spake to me as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you that which must be hereafter now the question to every true christian is this is john telling us the truth or is john lying to us we know he just gave counsel to the seven churches of asia which were alive and hopefully in good health when he first gave these letters to them but nonetheless they being of asia are know wise the same people of us today or even of the oncoming years thereafter so the events of chapter 4 clearly explained by john that his messenger as sent to him stated that he be taken up hither therefore a door opened in heaven the bible records and he was to be shown things which must be hereafter sometime after johns day now what did he behold in chapter 4 of revelations he says that he was in the spirit he immediately was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and he states that the throne was occupied someone sat on the throne and he that sat upon the throne was like a jasper a sardine stone i [indiscernible] say the scripture knows all the way through prophecy all the way through the bible as far as back as the days of genesis even to the prophecy of deuteronomy 32 where it says god is a rock he is our rock and his work is done in truth and in righteousness all the prophets refer to god as a rock now here we see in revelation john likewise written it says god has the appearance of a jasper and a sardine stone [indiscernible] there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald he carefully saw that there were living creatures around the throne saying that god is holy holy holy which was is and is to come god intended all things for which the pleasure they were and are created now this instruction emphasizes that there is a god a kingdom a judiciary in the respect that john witnesses that there were 24 elders sitting on 24 thrones seems to imply a judgment but uniquely enough in this judgment or in this throne or in this heavenly sanctuary as we see from the rise and fall of the apostles paul only talks about the heavenly sanctuary the heavenly sign in this sanctuary we see a god a rainbow a throne living creatures stating that god is holy which was is and come the past present and future and that this god this creator of all things is holy and deserves to be worshipped we continue on in chapter 5 to see that i beheld john says the right [indiscernible] that sat on the throne a book or a scroll sealed with seven seals notice its written on the inside and the backside well the meaning of these things kind of will be speculated until we have solid proof in other words unless we were there ourselves to see it in detail but what we are allowed to see in the scripture is john also beholds a might angel in this throne room where all these angels thousands ten thousand and thousands and thousands are called together and this mighty angel questions all in heaven who is worthy to open this book and to loose the seven seals thereof clearly scripture states no man in heaven neither on earth neither under the earth of course buried in other words we do have dead in this world you know was worthy to open neither to look thereon so hey god says in scripture at least john testifies in scripture that the mystery of god his book is sealed well what happens is as we continue on we see in chapter 5 that john begins to weep until one of the elders says weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof of which we know the lamb being a symbol of christ is brought to view and john beheld a lamb as it had been slain in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and the elders with seven eyes and seven horns well whats the meaning of these things', 'theyre back', 'if god does have a revelation [indiscernible]

denying what they themselves have sit and heard day by day so i know point blank that you know you have not asked them in regards to whether theyre going to see their parents again because the whole doctrine revolves around you know isaiah 49 where it says i will save thy children referring to the covenants and you know they they know all of these or at least are aware in conversational wise children that age usually do not have a conscience to discern or understand you know the high points of doctrine or philosophy but no the thing of it is that you know every one of these mothers tell them well ill see you soon so i dont know why youre saying that henry', 'well im not im not questioning you know your word you know i just', 'well i mean how you know by by your statement it implies that youre just making a statement but the question lies is did you really ask them', 'well see for example one of the kids you know came out with a note that says that that his name is joshua and that hes 7 years old and you know it lists all the different people that you know i guess are relatives of', 'relatives correct', 'okay', 'and weve and we asked we asked jim originally we said look jim because we first of all our children dont eat pork', 'okay', 'okay now whether you all uphold that or not we we cannot really guarantee that but come to find out instead of calling the because i understand it may take a day or two in some cases but instead of calling the present closest relative you all you all have gone ahead and put them down at the social place', 'um hum um hum', 'you know and which you know like i say thats kind of really neither here nor there at this point in time you know ive trusted jim i i would think that he would be smart enough not to consider these children you know worthy of a foster home or something like that because that would strictly violate the reasons why that you know most of these women and stuff would be coming out in the first place', 'okay',

time', 'uh huh', 'i mean thats another thing of trust again because like i say maybe thats what youre going to do maybe thats not what youre going to do you know we dont know as of yet like i say you know in my case i realize that you know ill ill never see my children again you know because you know i understand through through many many observations and through much history research you know how the government works and stuff like i say i will dance to the music that i i have played to you see what im saying', 'um hum', 'okay but the main thing is for me to stand up in front of my father my god and to present a truth that he gave to me because theres one reality thats above all realities and that is when the powers that control the universe you know when those other worlds and those other beings out way beyond when they come and communicate to you you know', 'um hum', 'a lot of people have a very elizabethan ideal of god you understand', 'um hum', 'they think gods got a beard and wears a robe and and not a very smart you know its kind of old you know traditional old english or you know god is very high tech gods got computer systems and technology above and beyond what this worlds ever seen', 'um hum', 'i know harry you see', 'um hum', 'in 1985 like i said i had a little visit when i was in israel ive always been a sincere guy like randy will tell you you know if you ever interview randy he knows i used to always tell him as a kid that you know theres got to be a god and all my life ive ive had this calling this you know these anyway but never mind but the thing comes down to this theres a test in latter days and its a test of human intelligence and all that which is human that is not going to use its intelligence i dont mean in regards to bureaucratic law', 'um hum', 'you see remember that two individuals that are into bureaucratic control', 'um hum', 'can cause millions of people to go to war', 'um hum', 'a hothead like hussein and a hothead like oh my mind lets see here the cuban guy castro', 'uh huh', 'see just their their one decision can cause many men to go and lose their lives right', 'right', 'well see you might call that a political thing', 'um hum', 'but it really its its politics is another form of religion', 'um hum', 'you see it denies a deity a sovereignty but still it has its principles', 'um hum', 'its philosophies and its well not theology its i guess humanology [sic] its utopianistic views', 'um hum', 'okay so the point that we finally come around to is this if you were in israel and you was confronted with you know something from beyond this world something that you know confronted you and communicated with you and told you what you must do and showed you things such as you have never dreamed see i used to stutter all my life i was a stutterer', 'um hum', 'i stammer all through school had a speech problem you know', 'uh huh', 'but after that event i never stuttered again', 'uh huh', 'but like i say we have to we have to realize that that in todays world with such modern technology everywhere we we have to look at old truths of the bible', 'um hum', 'in a modern way', 'um hum', 'and the modern way is is computerized technology seven seals what is it you know data program in other words what mind of man can be able to categorize all the testaments of the prophets and put it together into seven categories see now thats technology', 'uh huh', 'and the thing of it is its called wisdom', 'um hum', 'and scripture teaches us that if we fail to be interested in this riddle then the worlds that are beyond our world are going to destroy all those whose attitude have shown that they have not chosen to increase and grow in wisdom', 'um hum', 'see the prophecies themselves may be allegorical', 'um hum', 'they may be just little stories but nonetheless it still is a test', 'um hum', 'you know when youre when youre a little kid and they send you to a psychiatrist dont they put tell you to put these little blocks in this little block thing there and you got to shape up match up the sizes', 'right', 'okay well the same as this last revelation we have such pious and powerful men in the world such power look at the pontiff', 'um hum', 'you notice how powerful that religious man is', 'um hum', 'i mean no one questions the the history and origin of the papacy', 'um hum', 'i mean it killed millions the jesuit priesthood for those who went against its infallible laws the eucharist the catechism all the all the thousands and thousands of newborn babes they found in the catacombs you know and under the the chapels and stuff that they put in the lime pits of course we always thought that the virgin and the priest never did anything right', 'um hum', 'yeah but we find out later that there evil things were being done under a cloak', 'um hum', 'and martin luther rose up against it and how did he overthrow that system with truth', 'um hum', 'a bible truth', 'um hum', 'so today we we have a truth a bible truth but its not going to overthrow just the papacy', 'um hum', 'its going to you know bring all the world into a valley of decision people are going to have to hear it theyre going to have to say to themselves well you know thats right that is right that is exactly what is being said in harmony and that that does agree', 'um hum', 'then theyre going to wonder well i wonder who this guy really is', 'um hum', 'well the thing of it is is that im going to let you in on a secret about christ okay', 'okay', 'anyone that god chooses to place his power and spirit in no matter to what degree that spirit is all have the same spirit of the one and only living god', 'um hum', 'so what im saying is im saying that the spirit of elijah is no more different than the spirit of moses or the spirit of daniel or the spirit of hosea because these men as men can do nothing of themselves because all of these prophets had the spirits of christ', 'um hum', 'so christ did not come in person except he came in the person of his messengers', 'um hum', 'and the power of heaven strengthened these men and enlightened these men and gave these men gifts of knowledge and understanding to speak in behalf of christ', 'um hum', 'which is the true living god the word of god otherwise you know you cant put 2 ounces of faith in man its impossible', 'um hum', 'so anyway', 'okay', 'okay let me get back to this tape and what was what was the question again you was wanting you was wanting to know something else', 'well one of the things that that we have a concern about of course is the kids were hoping and were were certain that we want them to be reunited with their families we can count on that', 'yeah well we realize also and i was discussing it with some of the people here that that you know once we go out theres going to be you know now we realize our butts are in trouble there is some extensive research that has to be done you know someone is responsible for the deceasement [sic] of law enforcement officers', 'um hum', 'you know im im hopefully they say on the news that it shows clearly in regards to when the officers first approached it shows you know who fired first because i was standing right there in the door and i know you know that no fire came from our side first', 'okay', 'you see but the thing of it is is that my only hope would be for that is that is that those those cameras actually were zooming in enough on that front door', 'um hum', 'to show just exactly of course what i heard one guy comment was is that you know somebody saw somebody there with a firearm and so once they saw the firearm that thats a sign to go after it right', 'um hum', 'isnt that isnt that a atf rule or law i mean if if you all walked into a place and a guys standing there with a gun you know i mean thats thats what you got to do you got to draw out right', 'well', 'so thats probably where our problem came from', 'um hum', 'but you know i had my head and part of my body sticking out that door i was actually standing in the door there and i i waved out and thats probably all on film too and says you know get out of here theres women and children lets talk lets go get out you know so', 'um hum', 'you know i hope they', 'well one of the things that concerned us was that one of the mothers said to one of the kids ill see you on the other side so you know we were we just wanted to make sure', 'um hum', 'you see im i respect that very much i i appreciate that you know i thank god for that that you know under the circumstances that you have borne with me', 'um hum', 'you know so this gives the confidence you know because this is a great nation america and it should be you know more considerate and more intelligent in regards to these things', 'um hum', 'okay so now this gives me more liberty to entrust myself in the hands of this system you know for you guys to be able to help drive this situation out of the mud you know this is like a four wheeling truck and were all in it and were stuck you know and we all have to drive this thing out', 'okay', 'and thats what im saying im saying if you guys play right were going to play right', 'okay', 'i do not believe that how this got started was right but i was not going to you know allow after all the things have been said about me allow myself to just stand back and sit back and allow the system to come in and you know push push me around i cant do that', 'um hum', 'you see i cannot have the message of truth to be stifled that that easy', 'um hum', 'but you know you guys you and jim have been very very considerate very kind not at all like you know the aftermath of theres theres a batf video out on you guys its called breaking the law in the name of the law', 'um hum', 'im sure youve seen that of course like i say you know its its not meant to ultimately degradate you but its it just simply shows that people are human okay', 'um hum', 'on both sides so anyway i guess ive said enough and no you you tell the children that you know weve been letting them out little by little to see what you alls reaction was going to be because theyve been saying on the radio all the time that you all are fixing to hit us tonight you know', 'well no we', 'and jims been telling me thats not true', 'weve never had that plan you know we', 'so ive ive been balancing it out on both sides', 'okay', 'because like i say i have to stand in a position to where if you do hit us tonight', 'no', 'youre going to youre going to be guilty of killing little children', 'exactly', 'and the thing of it is is that thats why in the beginning i made it very plain i stood in the door there you know and thats not very fun with a bunch of professionals you know coming at you and i tried to tell them holler best i can lets talk about this i tried to talk to robert gonzales first you know', 'um hum', 'and you know i saw him on news here but i think its very cheesy in his behalf very very cowardish [sic] to be staying out of the light now because he could have and you tell him this he could have stopped all of this', 'um hum', 'you know his conscience is probably eating him up', 'um hum', 'so anyway', 'okay', 'okay im sorry so', 'well thats what we want', 'oh im im still here', 'no i dont think anyones going to commit suicide', 'nobodys going to be coming out playing john wayne', 'okay well', 'i mean have i mean are we letting our children out i mean you know are the children gone do the children look like theyve been abused or neglected', 'no no', 'okay so do they act abnormal except the one child because it was born that way it was', 'um hum', 'a medical misinterpretation you know the doctor didnt quite diagnose something right', 'um hum um hum', 'and it affected the child but are you happy with the children so far', 'yes yes', 'do they look like theyre raised strange abnormal', 'well just like jim said that and and like i say in our past experience together weve seen its been more shadowy on your side than its been on mine', 'i understand', 'i mean ive kept just like the other night jim told me not to deal with anybody else but him and we made an', 'um hum', 'an agreement and then you know another guy came along and and then all of a sudden da da da da da you know he we we he was very forceful and very strong and when someones going to play forceful and strong to me then im going to play forceful and strong back', 'that makes sense', 'you see but if someones going to sit down and say look im willing to give you you know 50 percent of the chips and ill take 50 percent of the chips and well play this card game fair', 'um hum', 'then you know when the chips are all on your side then ill ill fold up you know its a fair game', 'okay', 'and thats thats the way thats the way ive always been its the way ive always taught the doctrine that was given to me', 'okay', 'and this is the way the truth has to be', 'okay one of the things that i you know that i had a concern about and you dont have to give me the specifics on this but you know when weve talked about the number of children that are within the compound weve never had a real good idea and you dont need to tell me that but i feel', 'well ask the children that are there you know of course like i say they dont probably know either but just ask them if theres a lot more children thats all you have to do', 'right', 'thats', 'youre being very courteous but when it really comes down to it youre talking to me agent to criminal thats what were talking here okay', 'no im not talking to you agent to criminal', 'no but realistically thats what it is', 'what im', 'i have violated in all appearances the codes of the united states of americas law thats why now your job is to to deal with my mind and to try in your best ability to come to some feasible conclusion of how we can settle or resolve our problems or differences now because of this situation you know i am the one in trouble youre not okay now your courtesy im being very responsive to because i realize i am in trouble and i realize what the future holds for me even when i give myself up to you you know i dont know to what degree is going on my body right now but nonetheless i dont think i have to really worry too much about that because you know when i give myself over to you i still have to keep my mind on god because you know whatever i receive from the judicial system of america you know thats what i receive', 'okay but', 'and if god doesnt deliver me out of it then thats what i get', 'um hum', 'and its to the lords great wishes', 'um hum', 'but like i say the point is this everybodys going to know the importance of the seals then arent they', 'exactly', 'thanks to you', 'well', 'and thats very commendable', 'and thanks to you too but i want you to i dont want you to look at me as just somebody thats looking to you as a criminal im looking to to ensure as best as i can that you and everybody thats within the compound gets out alive and that these', 'right', 'children have an opportunity and that your mission and your cause because youre so devoted to it if you tell me look this is what i want to do to guarantee all of these peoples lives then im with you ill work with you as hard as i can', 'right well thats what thats what i was telling jim earlier i was telling look jim ive got a plan', 'okay', 'and the first thing i told him was is this i said jim i said look ive been hit and i get ive been getting weak i says ill tell you what you let me just lay here and let me die i says and give these people time to think', 'um hum', 'because i wont influence them', 'right i remember that', 'and i says and once im dead then theyre going to be sitting around here and theyre going to be thinking you see and ill be gone there will be no more influence and that way they can make decisions on their own see thats what i was first telling jim', 'um hum', 'you know and jim says no no no of course the other option is is that if if they dont give us time for the people to make these decisions you know then its always going to stay in the light that well as long as im the leader theyre going to do what i say but thats not the way this program is operated', 'uh huh', 'thats the way it appears you know and its true on that tape i did scream and i did call some people some stupid idiots but if you do the whole story', 'um hum', 'of what somebody had done', 'um hum', 'you dont mingle this truth with people that do perverse sins', 'um hum', 'now theres a reason why somebody just like christ anyway christ called the disciples fools didnt he', 'um hum', 'not that he was hating them but because they had done some foolish things', 'exactly', 'but the point is this what i need to do now is i need to buckle down and i need to you know i had some just a little bit of chicken soup here and', 'okay have you had any', 'oh yeah i had a little bit and', 'okay', 'and i need to readjust myself here and start doing this tape', 'okay', 'ive been going through these different tape machines the the big tape machine we we have some trouble with because it uses a akg phantom powered mike', 'um hum', 'and we havent been able to find it and the guys are kind of worried about turning on the lights in the building in case you know somebody you know how it is you know', 'if you tell me that youre going to turn the lights on you can go ahead and turn the lights on nothings going to happen you know', 'yeah because', 'i can advise the people that the lights are going to go on because were working on something', 'yeah', 'and its not going to be a problem', 'well what happened was that we went ahead and we got a couple of you know of higher quality hand held cassettes and i already know', 'oh okay', 'its got a dolby on it and as long as we have the dolby then the equalization is going to be audible enough to where they can remix it at the studio and play it live', 'okay', 'you know i am a musician you know', 'okay', 'so anyway okay well then ill ill get to this then well call you or youll call me at around 6 oclock then right', 'probably around 5 oclock', 'okie doke', 'okay', 'okay ill talk to you later then', 'ill talk to you then', 'bye', 'bye bye', 'steve', 'yeah okay were right now in the process of going to put him on the stretcher', 'okay', 'so itll

people are going to start picking it up', 'okay let me let me see now so when when its going to first be played at krld', 'right', 'so thats local but its going to be at what time at night', 'no i mean if you want it played more than once well you know once they play it once theyre going to everybodys going to be picking it up and its going its going to be played you know time and time again', 'okay but but the question is is that okay krlds going to play it first', 'yes', 'just because of local curiosity right', 'well not because of local curiosity because you asked it i mean you told me that', 'exactly i understand but', 'okay', 'but when is what time are they going to play it', 'as soon as you give it to me', 'oh i see okay but of course its real its real late now', 'well no', 'okay but thats all right anyway', 'i mean you know like', 'because theyll probably play it more than once', 'like like if we get it at at 5 oclock whatever theyll start playing it then', 'right', 'and theyll continue playing it you realize that', 'okay', 'okay and then', 'but when is when is the national going to play it', 'well they told us that they will play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock but thats', 'in the morning', 'huh yes but thats thats in thats arizona time which means it will be 11 oclock here when you know when you start', 'eleven to', 'until until 4', 'right okay okay', 'now how are you feeling', 'like i said its you know im weak but still i feel better i mean you know i mean physically yes but you know spiritually i feel a lot better', 'people people were saying that they were saying that they didnt think because i was talking so strong and all of that for a while that that id actually been shot but then tonight on the news one of the swat team officers said that he was the one that shot me he he shot me twice so that confirms it', 'well', 'i mean i', 'the', 'i was just i was just looking out the you know', 'the the concern that i have', 'the way there but', 'well look whats the foundation of religion whats man afraid of above anything in the world whats man afraid of by nature', 'death', 'death exactly okay so the scripture says in hebrews that christ died and rose from the grave so that he would have power over him that had power over dead which was the devil and redeem them who through their lives were afraid of death and therefore subject to bondage see some people in religion i mean like the jews back in those days they were so afraid of dying and being punished of god that they didnt really see the real meaning of the law the law was a revelation of a divine nature and they didnt understand the prophets how the law was to be properly interpreted they didnt really look to the animal sacrifices for what it really meant you know killing a lamb is really a dramatic thing', 'um hum', 'you know its sad something innocent has to die', 'um hum', 'because you did something wrong but the but the main key goes way back to cain and abel you know cain didnt want to kill the lamb did he no he wanted to bring his own fruits right', 'right', 'but when god blessed abel and didnt bless cain cain could kill his brother couldnt he', 'um hum', 'so you see this story repeats itself so those who do what god wishes you see according to gods word theyre like abels and those who do not do gods wishes well then theyre like cains', 'um hum', 'so now the question right now between us and you guys was which one was the cain and which one was the abel', 'well', 'you know or maybe we were both one and the same', 'um hum well', 'but', 'i will', 'let me ask you this and when i was talking to one of the ladies there earlier she indicated that theres some nurses in there that may be you know kind of looking out after you', 'well theyve been like changing these weve been using like sheets', 'okay', 'off a bed and wrapping it around tied it up and then it gets wet so then we if i lay still for a while and if i dont laugh i mean this is not funny like id be laughing but', 'um hum', 'you know sometimes you laugh for nothing better else to do but if i dont laugh and if i dont cough then it stops bleeding', 'um hum', 'but if i move a certain way or laugh or especially cough then boy it starts coming out again', 'im working on it', 'additionally you know does anybody in there have a a blood pressure cup that they can take your blood pressure', 'oh yeah', 'you you have one', 'oh yeah weve got weve got', 'dont touch it dont touch it because its you know someone was touching the cord and its jittery', 'oh okay', 'so that what i do is i i always teach with questions', 'okay', 'so i i teach my students i say now look i cant save you you know i am not anything as far as you can see any different from what you can see you know', 'um hum', 'we are not to worship men so ill tell them look this is a ill make them read the revelation of who who gave it to him what reason then when i take them throughout the revelation their eyes are seeing the book their mind is developing pictures so that when we get into the part of the seals they see very clearly the scripture teaches that none but the lamb can reveal these things and i go now wait right here the lamb reveals it he reveals the first seal is a man on a white horse', 'um hum', 'now you know whats so hard about understanding that apparently it seems like hes going to war seems like christ is not only a savior hes a destroyer conquering and conquering except we cant speculate can we of course they agree with me i says now we shouldnt add our opinions because we really dont know the details of this i says look here at the second seal they are given a great sword that they should kill one another i said now why how does that reveal jesus you know christ doesnt teach to kill one another you know he teaches love and turn the cheek doesnt he', 'um hum', 'so we cant speculate here', 'um hum', 'so then when we get to chapter 10 after we begin to read throughout the seven seals the trumpets start in the seventh seal my students are brought to the attention of very strange and weird symbols or omens which again speculation is not the facts', 'um hum', 'now we get to chapter 10 we see that sometime during the sixth trumpet john records and i saw another mighty angel sent from heaven clothed with a cloud and as faded as it were the sun you know and his feet as pillars of fire stood up on the earth and sea had his little handbook opened and he cries and a lion roareth when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now again we dont know what this is all about all we know is that the only thunders we know about is in gods throne the lightning thunders and voices we know when the lamb opens the first seal there is the first thunder but it says john is told to seal those things and write them not but john was told that the mighty angel swore by the god that created all things when theres time no longer this mystery of god will be finished so see my students begin to think about those things what is this mystery of the the little book thats opened whats this mystery of the the revelation of jesus christ and of course the last chapter when we learn about the river of the water of life we know that christ is the lord god of the holy prophets you know christ is the one who from the beginning of time spake into the prophets because he is the word of god', 'um hum', 'made angel or hes the word of god made flesh it depends on what the will of the father really is but the keynote is he promised he says i sent my angel and he says i come upwards with me so then at that point my students begin to realize that the coming of christ has something to do with a message a message that only he can reveal', 'um hum', 'so then i ask them well would you like to learn the seven seals now of course they look at me real funny then dont they', 'um hum', 'yeah see once we get that established about the judgment that only the lamb can reveal these things and when i ask them would you like me to show you the seals i wont tell you but ill show you then they look at me real funny like well hey you cant show me these things and i go well thats right i cant but christ can right well yeah i says well let me show you something here in chapter three of revelation it says these saith he that is holy he hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth i go what is that key of course they dont know and i go let me show you i tell them theres 150 psalms that david of ove [phonetic_sp] wrote the psalms you know', 'um hum', 'and christ is the root and offspring of david isnt he', 'um hum', 'god promised david to christ that one day god would sit on the throne of david in the flesh of christ right', 'um hum', 'and that was fulfilled in christ', 'yeah', 'so then i began to take them to the 45th psalm and i go now lets open this psalm up and lets look at what gods thinking about when you come up here to my church youll see the father sitting on the throne and the reason why he wants to know who can reveal his thoughts is because he put his thoughts down in a book he does this so that we can receive mercy and grace instead of wraths or unrighteousness which is not too righteous so then the 45th psalm begins to talk in behalf of god now i always emphasize at my students stop looking at me theyve got to look at god they got to be in the spirit', 'um hum', 'so then when this 45th psalm starts saying my heart is inditing a good matter you know were looking at the rock right were looking at god whose got the book right', 'um hum', 'and we already know the first seal pertains to a man on a white horse right', 'um hum', 'so whose heart is it davids heart or is it gods heart well the scripture says david was a man after gods own heart not in the same magnitude but nonetheless the same spirit of the future where the son of god was to be made manifest god says his hearts inditing a good matter he wants to talk about the things he has made hes a creator isnt he', 'um hum', 'touching his king', 'um hum', 'and his tongue is the pen of a ready writer so its written in the book isnt it', 'um hum', 'so that we find in psalms 45 that he does write prosperously he does have a bow he does have a crown because of truth now that doesnt mean that when christ comes hes going to come on a white horse with a bow and shoot people in the heart in their heart with an arrow but it does mean that theres a truth that must be made known because the real thing to emphasize in that 45th psalm is when it says upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir now the question is who is that queen is she a literal girl or is she a church nonetheless whether shes literal or spiritual nonetheless love is literal whether we love christ spiritually or whether we love him literally theyre one in the same okay now it says hearken o daughter and consider now whether were a girl or not all of us who have eyes to see should consider in the 45th psalm who god has revealed so that in revelation 19 when the marriage lamb comes its very clear in that chapter who that man on the white horse is and it says that he has a name of course in 19 it says behold i saw a white horse and he that sat upon him had a crown many crowns on his head he takes those crowns off the leeches of the earth youll find in other prophecies it says he has a vesture dipped in blood and his name is the word of god okay', 'um hum', 'so the keynote is that we begin to learn that what the revelation is is its a well look you know you know in a movie when they want to advertise a movie', 'uh huh', 'they dont they dont sit there and give you 15 20 minutes of the movie do they with advertisement what do they give you a preview right', 'exactly', 'okay so if the mystery of god the seven thunders are the seven seals if it is to be finished as god declared to the prophets then found in the prophecies are the seven seals', 'um hum', 'and youll find that in the first seal the truth there is about christ destroying his enemies', 'um hum', 'and the only enemies he destroys are those who are against his truth', 'um hum', 'and thats regarding the marriage which unitifies [sic] humanity and divinity into one mind only gods thoughts are worth anything you see mans thoughts are vanity', 'um hum', 'but gods thoughts are eternal', 'um hum', 'so through truth we learn why christ says in the gospel of john when he says my hes having a fight with the sanhedrin remember', 'um hum', 'and the pharisee says my doctrine is not mine its that which i received from my father', 'um hum', 'so hes trying to tell him its gods book he says now if you continue in my doctrine youre my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free', 'uh huh', 'now you know no ones free today right were all in bondage [indiscernible] arent we', 'um hum', 'so we have to learn these seals', 'um hum', 'of course we dont just learn the seals we do the seals', 'um hum', 'as we learn the seals we do the seals', 'um hum', 'obedience not just hearing but obedience', 'um hum', 'so anyway if you ever get a chance to read the 45th psalm look at it judge it for yourself', 'okay', 'and look at the first seal and see if those things kind of look exactly alike', 'well what im going to do is im going to tell everybody', 'uh huh', 'what my negotiations with you are', 'okay', 'and in so doing everybody will know that when we have done and completed our work then weve done our work and everything and theres no reason to die because like i say the truth is to give life its not to give death', 'right', 'and the whole key is this you know christians in general believe that if they shall serve god they shall be persecuted', 'um hum', 'but in our generation even though sin does abound great is a lot let me say this much though sin abounds greatly more so than ever before', 'um hum', 'the point still is as graced as much more abound', 'um hum', 'remember the seals are not revealed to condemn us or destroy us theyre theyre revealed so that all those who profess christ can come together into one body', 'um hum', 'thats what brings the fall of confusion theres too many organizations professing to believe in one god', 'yeah', 'oh it scares me', 'okay', 'professing to believe in one god and yet theres only one doctrine remaining for us to know to bring us all into unity', 'um hum', 'of the faith you know we cant have faith and and presumption', 'hello', 'yeah', 'whats causing that', 'i dont know it must be your cord somebody must be stepping on it or pulling at it or something', 'right okie doke okay let me', 'now you because of because of the way that you have revealed the seals and and your understanding of the biblical readings i have to assume that everybody thats contained within there', 'theres two plans god always gives two ways out', 'okay', 'you see god see if you had a better if you had a better understanding of the prophecies for instance in isaiah where it says behold for the mountains of fear that brings good tidings', 'um hum', 'its a sad story of isaiah 52 and 53', 'um hum', 'okay but whereas in nahum behold will the mountains it tells you a different story', 'um hum', 'not that the two prophecies do not harmonize but god has a plan like in ezekiel where god says that if i shall pronounce a blessing against a people you know because theyve kept my laws you know then if they shall break my laws that the blessing that i pronounced against them i will take away and if i also curse a nation than it shall be no more that i shall destroy if it turned from its wicked ways then will i also turn from my evil which i have proposed to do and will bless them so ezekiel tells us in 33rd chapter that you know god has no pleasure in the death of the wicked', 'um hum', 'no pleasure', 'um hum', 'so the thing of it is that like paul says in hebrews 6 he says that that therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ he says the doctrine of baptism and resurrection you know hes talking about the simple things you know the very first steps in christianity he says lets go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of these simple doctrines you know the basic things like jesus loves me and he died for me and i must be baptized you know we we do that once right', 'um hum', 'he says for its impossible for those who were once enlightened if they shall fall away in other words dont progress with truth you know peter says be established in the present truth which means if theres a present truth there must be a past truth if if theres like we might believe the message of noah now right', 'um hum', 'but in the days of noah no one believed it', 'um hum', 'they perished because of unbelief', 'right', 'now we may believe the message of moses but the message of moses is over those in his day didnt believe it', 'um hum', 'but you see now we may believe the message of christ 2 000 years ago', 'um hum', 'but of course when it was being given nobody believed it', 'right', 'you see thats the whole thing now today weve got one final revelation of course you know everyone believes in jesus today', 'um hum', 'just like everyone believed in moses in christs day', 'yeah', 'but maybe they dont know that christ like they should', 'youre right', 'so you offer them the seven seals you know and well like 2 000 years ago you know the sanhedrin says to christ we be not the sons born of fornication sure its easy today to accept christ as a virgin birth right', 'um hum', 'but back then the general public view was that he was born mary had had fornication with somebody', 'um hum', 'you know so you know they always see christ as lovely and meek but when you when you read whats going on oh when you read the gospels he could throw over some tables at the church couldnt he', 'um hum', 'he was considered radical by a lot of people', 'right', 'but certain people just pick up highlights of his nature and dont look at the other side', 'um hum', 'so when he warns us in the book of revelation he gives specific counsels to the churches of asia hey the lord dont mess around he tells church of ephesus returning to the first verse there ill take your candle away', 'um hum', 'now if you walk in darkness youre going to end up in hell you know smyrna thyatira sardis they ought to see he tells them that theyre lukewarm hot or cold he says ill spew you out of my mouth who and is that the same christ we learn about on the cross hey you just you just let a man crucify you once', 'thats right', 'and then the thing of it is the guy says im sorry okay can forgive him but then he needs to open his eyes and he needs to learn a little obedience doesnt he', 'um hum', 'okay but the thing of it is if he turns away from you the second time isnt he crucifying you afresh', 'really', 'you would think okay so now by the world turned away from these seven seals just because im ugly or they may think im crazy you know i didnt think were supposed to judge anybody according to flesh', 'really well i think that that youre going to reveal the way to you know to safety for for your people you know and were going to of course afford you the opportunity to make that tape do you think youre going to be working on that very soon', 'yeah im fixing to get on it right now', 'okay well i just want you', 'this is what ive been wanting for the longest time', 'i realize that', 'as you know christ youre supposed to walk in him thats what the new covenant teaches us but at the same time youre not supposed to reject any additional light that comes', 'thats right', 'youre supposed to grow into the full stature of the body of christ', 'um hum', 'and your faith virtue virtue and the knowledge in all his temperance you know like i say were supposed to grow as colossians says', 'thats right', 'receiving the knowledge in him when it comes all the new testament writers if you really read those writings again romans all the way through youll find all of them are talking about one day christ is going to come and reveal seals thats what theyre all talking about about that knowledge of of that god had bodily you know', 'um hum', 'talking about the knowledge of the of the spirit thats within christ', 'um hum', 'so seven seals', 'okay i want you', 'because christ is one body all the prophets and apostles are hid in one body', 'um hum', 'one bread and one wine', 'um hum', 'one truth so you gentiles are were supposed to have an opportunity too in the latter days and were here there now and you know why would why would christ come back as a holy and and perfect person when you all dont even believe in the law anymore', 'um hum', 'even though the law was nailed to the cross wasnt it', 'thats right', 'but you know because the law is nailed to the cross now you take a look at the law and he and he says father forgive them so how much more you who stands down at the foot of the cross are to forgive your neighbor', 'um hum', 'one sinner to another sinner you know should forgive one another', 'thats right', 'but even more so we should realize that that good spirit went into the hand of god and the word theres three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one', 'um hum', 'and thats where we have to really pay attention if we want to win the reward of righteousness', 'um hum', 'to realize it in every generation they would not hear the prophets because like hosea he had to marry two prostitute wives didnt he', 'um hum', 'okay isaiah walked naked and barefoot so did micah', 'um hum', 'i mean god does obstacles like you would never think someone like someone like samson could be a judge of israel could you', 'thats right', 'i mean but you know he went around and messed around with philistine women didnt he', 'um hum', 'and the father says is there never a daughter amongst my own brethren and he says no get this philistine girl for me because she pleased me well the scripture says for they knew not that it was of the lord for lord had an occasion against the philistines you know just so much stuff in the scripture people overlook about the mysterious ways so back at christ in his day he says regard ye amongst the heathen and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days that you will not believe though it be told you and then he talks about destroying the nations by discovering the foundation unto the neck well if you didnt know daniel 2s prophecy about the image we talked about earlier', 'um hum', 'you would never know what it meant in regards to discovering the foundation what is the foundation well the foundation of the kingdom of god is in truth and the truth is in the days of these kings daniel says gods tolerance of the gentile nations ruling over his people is over gods going to gather back the hundred and four thousand gods going to choose the jews because the gentiles are going to do worse to a messiah who comes who comes to teach the truth than what the jews did 2 000 years ago and i would do anything to avoid that to keep that from happening', 'okay', 'okay', 'but but help me', 'so let me get this tape', 'help me understand what your role is you are with respect to revealing the seals is it the lamb', 'well remember the lamb well look in psalms 4 that will tell you who i am', 'okay', 'see psalms 1 psalms 2 remember the anointed one the heathen rage', 'um hum', 'and they say lets break their bands asunder', 'um hum', 'what ties the son to the father the word', 'um hum', 'and what portion of gods word has been sealed seven truths of the bible right', 'um hum', 'okay now the challenge is for anybody in the world my friend', 'okay', 'anybody so in psalms 3 the psalm goes on to say lord how are they increased to trouble me for they be many that rise up against me there be many say of my soul theres no help for him in god but it also says ill be not afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves together against me round about in psalms 4 it says help lord it says hear me when i call o god of my righteousness then it says o you sons of men how long will you love vanity how long will you turn my glory into shame how long will you seek after leasing he tells them he says but you should know that god has separated him apart that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him yes stand in awe and sin not serve the lord with fear rejoice with trembling you see', 'um hum', 'meditate upon your own bed', 'okay', 'now see the thing of it that psalm all the psalms are a dialogue of christ you see the sons of men turn his glory to shame because they dont know where hes coming from', 'um hum', 'you know who has god separated apart thats godly for himself who christ', 'um hum', 'and heaven christ but when he comes again according to whats written with the bands and the seals', 'um hum', 'and the by the book is written of me theyre not going to know what god has already said because theyre not going to listen to what god says', 'um hum', 'only what god says can reveal who we are', 'um hum', 'and either we are with the same wheel of god or were not', 'yeah', 'okay so ill make this tape and that way', 'good', 'people can copy it and they can go over it a few times', 'well im going to have a little chicken soup now i think', 'well like i said you know lets make this arrangement lets get this tape done and what time is it anyway im im upside down when it comes to time', 'its about a quarter after 1', 'oh its already 1 oclock huh', 'um hum', 'well can we start this again at 6 oclock in the morning is that all right', 'well you know there are just so many children', 'i know there is theres a lot of them here but you said you was going to do something for me now', 'yes', 'and i was doing this the way im doing it now to see what kind of trust i could develop in jim', 'well now', 'you know', 'well', 'okay now', 'at one time now you now you do you believe that', 'ill have to be carried', 'well well carry you out', 'okay', 'now', 'okay good', 'okay', 'okay i want to tell you something', 'i dont want you to come in', 'just to show you my good faith is you know we called krld', 'uh huh', 'theres nobody answering the phone there so were sending somebody there', 'well theres one number over the line that can the normal number they wont answer right now so yeah okay so if you sent someone there thats fine', 'um hum okay now are you ready to send somebody out now', 'yeah', 'okay', 'you got the van there', 'everybody', 'thats correct', 'yeah because like unless see what im on right now is like i said you know when i got hit', 'um hum', 'took everything in my power to just feel the to crawl okay', 'well no we dont want you to crawl', 'and finally well let me explain finally what happened was i couldnt i just i mean everything was getting numb', 'yeah', 'so i finally ended up where im at now', 'um hum', 'and that just that was it i couldnt go no more', 'okay', 'and so you know its like we got a whats this thing called a sponge a sponge kind of you know halfway on the sponge', 'yeah', 'my back halfway on a pillow', 'yeah', 'you know on blankets and then i got this', 'okay now', 'towels or sheets wrapped around my holes in my stomach', 'okay now how much time do you want us to give you to make the tape', 'well like i say we should we should have something done by at least 6 in the morning', 'okay', 'is that all right [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] i mean because because see no ones no ones going to want to play it for you know for any more than 30 minutes thats just the way even even standardized you know short sermons are no more than 30 minutes so in order for me to be able to to make my statements clear im going to have to you

together to where it doesnt because i dont want to sound like [making_panting_noises] you know', 'yeah right', 'i dont want i dont want that could be distracting', 'well i feel a lot better now because youre doing this for me', 'okay', 'its you know one thing about human weakness i used to run track', 'um hum', 'and i used to be a long distance runner', 'okay', 'and the thing of it is is that when you start seeing that final stretch you know and you pace yourself', 'um hum', 'its a mental thing', 'okay', 'then that last little bit of stretch you know you get this new wind', 'um hum', 'okay', 'and except i just drink a little orange juice to wet my mouth but im going to get some chicken soup and we need to send a couple of children out to you now', 'okay', 'because its getting kind

ye forever well gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty is christ the most mighty with thy [indiscernible] thy majesty i mean it seems like in revelation all in heaven bowed before the lamb did they not thats a lot of glory but ill explain received power honor glory riches wisdom kingdom might oh thats a lot of inheritance there especially the gospel says i received all things my father says [indiscernible] because of truth so what could this truth be some truths in the bible talks about riding a horse prosperously and its truth could it be revelations could it be the first seal maybe a truth about christ maybe a truth about him being a king [indiscernible] crown could it be a truth about him having a horse riding conquering into conquerors huh [indiscernible]

the driveway okay', 'well', 'oh i i understand', 'yeah', 'oh yeah', 'yeah', 'well david and you can can you know agree with me and then we can explain it to everyone and and they can understand it and we appreciate their concern and im what im were so concerned that it go smoothly we dont want any', 'exactly', 'yeah', 'thats thats oh believe me thats the main concern thats the main concern', 'okay all right', 'so what well do then is like you', 'well all right let me let me talk to the commanders and and one', 'okay thanks jim', 'be one second okay', 'okay sure', 'hey just hang on', 'i will i am', 'hosea seems to say the word is that youre not high people there should be said youre the sons of the living god so [indiscernible] says in the gospel if he calls him god [indiscernible] the laws not be broken well learning gods word and gods spirit this is what makes us become born again born by the spirit acknowledging god well so so a girl believes in god so does everybody else that believes in god so therefore god the father has many children doesnt he christ being the firstborn and thereon everything all thereafter did believe but instead of my father should be my children and thou mayest make princes in all the earth to the person that doesnt really understand scripture this would seem to be a very controversial subject i mean christ never had any wife has to be spiritual i will make thy name remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever well even if it is spiritual we know one thing we the servants of god know that psalm 45 is the very prophecy which must be hereafter according to the first seal but just to make sure we know its going to be fulfilled lets turn in our bibles to revelation 19 just so we can get a better caption of what we are really looking at now remember in the 18th chapter of revelation we know that babylon the great fall she made all nations drink of some kind of wine of the wrath of her fornication now we find that something very bad happened and at verse 23 of chapter 18 no more light of a candle shall shine there nor the voice of the bridegroom or the voice of the bride well the merchants were the great men of the earth it says in verse 23 and for their by thy sorceries were all nations deceived we all know about capitalization we know about advertisement selling something making it better than what it really is and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth you see just because people dont accept the truth in gods word does not mean its not true theres some truth that we might teach could get us in trouble but anyway the first chapter 19 it says and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in the heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power to the lord our god why for true and righteous are his judgments i wonder [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]', 'steve', 'yeah',

do for people', 'im not trying to con you im telling you facts that i have', 'youve got to trust to trust me', 'for me to con you would be stupid', 'i can accomplish that for you but i cant do it as

cant imagine anybody doing it under these circumstances', 'but in the meantime your dogs cowering in a corner scared to death', 'well i dont think so i think theres a lot of room and you could do a lot of things and theres plenty of help available [pause] okay', 'you have the whole system available to you its up to you now to use it the whole system is waiting and you can work that system any

six pack of beer and two packs of cigarettes', 'just let me come out and help please', 'okay now try to keep it short because you know the these people are not going to want to play something thats real long okay', 'and you know we we had some initial difficulties about you know how long they would play it but we we really hung in there and and stood up', 'we stood up and said listen you know we want you to play his whole message', 'no editing we we really stood firm for you so i i hope you realize that', 'okay this is what we want to do were the people at the network we like i say we we battled them to get the whole message and and they they said they will do it and its an hour its a solid hour david', 'well as soon as as soon as this is all done thats when i told him that that you know i would i would give all that information out', 'thats what we originally worked out', 'okay well what were oh i understand that and and we trust you and we just want to kind of prepare in advance you know to have some buses out there so we can take you together and you know you know we instead of a bunch of cars and we were kind of hoping that you know you would lead the way you know some of the folks might be scared and', 'well david youve kept your word and so have we', 'and ill tell you our only reason for these questions about the people is just logistical you know', 'so we can call ahead to the hospital to say look we have a man who has an arm wound we have a you know david has a wound in his lower abdomen you know so they can prepare to treat you', 'thats the only reason i mean im not i mean theres no secret behind it and then just to have the number of vehicles there you remember the glitches we had the other day when the car wasnt ready and then the people at the christian broadcast network you know their their position and and you understand the news okay', 'and then also i dont want it to get dark on us and that many people getting ready you know with the children the mothers would take a little while', 'you know you know just get a head count tell her to take a piece of paper just count everybody and that will help us with the buses and then the the other thing is especially important is you know people who cant walk yourself and any others can we', 'well thats thats another reason for us to make these preparations david you know what i mean', 'i dont know i dont know thats another reason not to delay because were going to get the message on and and once it is you know theres no reason for you not to get that medical care just as quick as we can', 'well listen after you walk out of there and your your words going to get out even more im telling you its going to get out even more', 'the truth will get out when when you come out of there even more so just remember that okay', 'well its a big place and we were concerned that everybody in the inside got the word you know and that there wasnt somebody off in a room that that didnt get the word you know', 'all right and i trust you and you trust me', 'all the trust i want all the trust of everyone in there do you', 'okay and make those arrangements because we we want to get you out right after your message is played', 'so you can get some treatment', 'okay and you know how everybodys concerned about money and i mean everybody is has a concern can you do me a favor and can you make it you know like in such a fashion that that in order to avoid their wanting to chop it up or to play part of it or whatever', 'oh i dont have any idea i have no idea but what id like to do is i would like for you to make it as concise and as brief as you can make it so that we can be in a situation where your word will will get out nothing will be chopped off your message will go out as you want it you know', 'we dont need that we what we want is we want you to you were given your cooperation and thats what we promised what we would do so i want to live up to my part of it yeah i dont need your money but i do need [touch_tone_sounds]', 'okay now now listen listen to what im going to tell you i dont know if this van is going to stop in exactly the same place as the other van its going to be real close the only reason that im telling you that is whoevers going to take the kids there you know these are two new people because weve had a changing of a shift okay so', 'but but i mean you know they may be 20 feet back or or 5 feet forward from where they parked before i dont want her to get a concern whoever it is thats taking them there well its they didnt park in exactly the same place nothings', 'going to happen other than what has happened before', 'we want to we want to continue in that same vein we dont want to change anything or or make anything in such a fashion you know and when you kept telling me that there was somebody in that tower or in the roof i knew that there wasnt anybody you know because', 'well he was busy', 'no <name> i honestly dont know i aint telling you no bull i just i dont know no more to tell you than what im told', 'theyre not necessarily the ones who are going to serve it you know a warrant a warrants not the end of the end of the world', 'id like to hear your side of it', 'ok well theyll get you one then thats the law you know', 'well shes busy right now you know you and i can work this out ok because im the one whos going to talk to the <name> for you you know they got me out of bed in the middle of the night and said theres a guy up here hes got a problem thats what im doing here ok so if i got up in the middle of the night let me work on it for you alright you understand what i am saying', 'well let me prove it to you im not going to get up in the middle of the night and come all the way up here from <place> to lie to somebody if i was going to do that i wouldnt have made the trip lets talk about the warrant and and you know a solution ok', 'we get this out of the way and you can talk to your mother twenty four hours a day', 'yes but we might we might need to use the phone to get this authority through so lets lets keep it simple and well handle one thing at a time', 'but that aint what i been asking for', 'if i can talk to her i can probably slighten the problem a little bit', 'well shes shes not the appropriate person to talk to about you know about this kind of situation your mothers not going to talk to the attorney general you know i dont have any problem with you talking to your mother but lets take first things first here', 'mhm mhm see thats delaying what we want to do in getting this getting this thing this warrant handled because the <name> may have to call somebody', 'you know shes been up all night too you ought to give her a break', 'well you probably wont have to go anywhere but you know the reason the reason im talking about the warrant and so forth and and and i know you want to talk to your mother is to handle things one thing at a time get them done you know the right way and then theres no problem telling to your mother but we we just got the one phone here and we are going to do some checking on this warrant so we are going to need this phone in other words we are working together on this thing we are working for you so your gonna have to understand that ok so im if if you need me try to call me and if the phone is busy that means we are calling somebody about this warrant to find out some of the details how we can handle the thing and but if you need me and you can get through to me ask for <name> ok', 'and its important i need to talk to her', 'well i can come later i need to talk to her now my little girl is going to have to come first', 'thats why i need to talk to her', 'dont you think if we handle something in your interest that thats in hers too', 'well i know that but you know we dont know each other to well right', 'and those are some of the things you know that i gotta make sure arent going to happen just like i said im going to help you right if you let me help you', 'you know im not going to bs you ok im going to be realistic with you but on the same token on the same hand you know i id like for us to do something together and thats thats basically regarding the baby there we dont have any problems unless we make problems', 'and that baby is going to be waking up pretty soon i dont know about you but im not a very good babysitter i dont get enough practice for one thing that sure would make things easier for us im talking about you and i if we can get that thing resolved', 'ok how about if we talk about it first so we dont have any mistakes do it the simplest way possible', 'mhm mhm see thats a thats a problem for for ah for some of the people here whether they can trust you or not', 'i know i know that might sound funny to you you know but you and i dont know each other that well and you know ive gotta responsibility that if you know <name> and i talk about this and <name> and i make a deal that <name> is gonna gonna to do what he says ive already promised you im going to do what i say bound by that', 'yes but you you gotta understand that you know we are responsible down here', 'well its better to get it all from you did you ever play that game when you were a kid in school where you pass around something around the table this guy says something to this guy and this guy says something to that guy and by the time it gets around the table its a little different', 'well believe me that happens so so thats why i want to talk to you about it so that they dont lose anything in what they call lose it in translation does that make sense to you', 'if youre gonna do something do the right thing in good faith lets lets help you out too ok', 'well resolve the other thing with the warrant i think you are going to have a pretty good day', 'ok ok <name> let me ill get your <name> for you ok but we gotta i im not trying to cut you off here but i wanna limit the time that you have with her on the phone because we are going to need the phone to take care of this other problem ok', 'why not what what what can what would i accomplish by lying to you', 'well thats basically really what we are talking about here i told im im not going to lie to you and im not it it doesnt it doesnt do any good to do that you know if we are if we are gonna come to an agreement on this thing its gotta be based on the truth you said that the thing you didnt like is you dont want to go to jail well youre not going to jail what they are going to do is book you and thats in one door and out the other', 'yes what what would that that wouldnt serve any purpose', 'first ok well go with well go with your suggestion on this thing well take care of all that other stuff too well well take one thing at a time we proved to each other that we are not im not trying to bs you i didnt come up here to do that i came up here to help you let me get right back to you ok <name>', 'well its just in in best interest <name> is all', 'im keeping my word', 'shes on the way i cant stop her', 'they theyre going out the door right now', 'you see i misunderstood you then you said let me talk to i said that i was goning your <name> was coming up to get <name> and you said we will let me talk to her first and thats when i put you mother on see you and i havent talked that much about <name> you said that that you were lied to because you were going to talk to <name> but you and i you and i never talked about that you understand that', 'and what i wanted was a show of good faith from you you know you are going to have to let me help you if i am going to help you you understand my my situation', 'well that was our deal i thought that that you were gonna have you <name> pick up <name> and then talk to <name> see thats why thats why you know it sounds like im going into details here and i am because i dont wanna i dont wanna do the wrong thing see i didnt understand that', 'well because because youre not doing anything in your own best interest and thats is letting your <name> pick up <name> what do you want to talk to <name> about', 'hes going to get you out of trouble you wont have to go to jail', 'well thats like he said youll be going in one door and out the other one', 'you didnt kill nobody its not that bad', 'what did he tell you said i would have to spend ten days in jail and pay a fine ten days well thats better than year', 'what else you want they did a lot for you theyre getting you out of trouble', 'well youd rather talk to a psychiatrist than go to jail wouldnt you', 'ok well i wanna hug her <name>', 'let me help you out of this situation i know i know that right now it doesnt look that great but gees dont dont get all bent out of shape about it you know we can work it out and remember i said before its a walk through that still holds we can still do that <name> youll be out drinking <name> in the early morning sun', 'that we are still going to get this warrant i told you we are going to get the warrant held that way we still can get it held that way nobody is going to come in there and rough you up or anything like that and and <name> said that you know hed give you a ride down there would you let me prove that to you', 'sure you did and you are if i had an uncle in <place> and i got in trouble he could sign my bond doesnt matter where you live the bond is the bond you know your mother trusts you and shes taking responsibility by signing a bond', 'ok sooner you get down there sooner you get out', 'because i wanna prove to you im a man of my word ok', 'and do it for you too ok', 'youre coming back', 'youre not gonna go to jail', 'i understand what youre saying i dont have control over that what i what ill do is ill do the best that i can but i want you to understand that if it comes out chopped up it has nothing to do with me you know were we', 'okay well okay what ill do is i will i will see how things work out ill do the best i can for you i cant guarantee anything on this because of the length of the tape so please dont be upset at me because you know well just do the best that we can

thats exactly what im going to do you know i i have no problems doing you know this and whatever you know', 'and you know and likewise ive been trusting you okay', 'but the press was saying last night that we were storming the place at eight oclock and i told you we werent and we havent and even when you thought that somebody was on the roof i told you that we were not', 'and we didnt', 'okay now i agree with you on all of these things you know and i love america you know and youll find in my past record that you know im not a bad person in 1988 if you research that so called gun battle youll find out i went plenty of times to the sheriffs department and asked them to come out here and deal with george roden on that corpse abuse thing you know if you research that youll find that out and when i was told point blank that i had to get these pictures and as we were walking out sheriff dixon says now boys be careful you know there are some dangerous customers out there', 'oh look if i wanted to commit suicide i would have done it already now let me explain something', 'we were accused three times this last year of going to commit suicide three times the authorities were roused up by letters from martbro [phonetic_sp] and all that here we here weve been digging lakes in the front fixing this place up from a rat hill hoping that one day we might have this place finished to be able to present it true to all those who want to come but at the same time knowing that as long as there were people who would not look at the truth we could not sit with idle expectation and think that were always going to be able to to have this freedom that weve enjoyed weve never gone outside our boundaries weve done things that are legal you know always suspicion on every hand you know but the thing of it is is that if there is anything in question we need to take it to the bible christians are supposed to take it to the law and the testimony of gods scripture now otherwise we are commanded by scripture to abide by the laws of the land in every degree as long as those laws dont 100 percent conflict with the law of god in nebuchadnezzars day when nebuchadnezzar had that dream you know daniel and them were subject to the babylonian kingdom werent they they kept the laws of chaldea didnt they but when it came for nebuchadnezzar to make that image and he commanded all people to bow to it', 'and we want to get you out of there as soon as possible because you know your blood pressure isnt all that good youre not you know with all those blankets that you have on you you

machine what would you do go ahead now i wanna hear this answer', 'all right because youre not in my shoes', 'no one could ever see if my daughter used to be a fucking low life tramp', 'well do you know why probably because they were concerned that your daughter was laying there dying thats why', 'why would we want to shoot you to death if they wanna shot they can go down the range and shoot they dont have to shoot at you', 'all right our main concern is your daughter thats lying there and possibly dying as youre talking on the telephone', 'why dont you let us take her out now youre gonna keep this up until she dies is that what youre gonna do huh is that the kind of father you are', 'everytime she calls her mother a cunt she tells her mother to fuck herself and me too come on give me a break i didnt invest all this time into hear her a monster', 'but is that reason to shoot her <name> come on', 'youre letting her lay there suffering <name> you think she feels good right now', 'no

get into the house the only reason was because of the daughter', 'all right but shes laying there on the floor right and youre changing compresses and the only reason they tried to enter the house was because they dont want her to bleed to death all right and <name> youre not a doctor', 'no matter how many compresses or wet towels or ice packs you put on her all right the girl is laying on the

and talk to the officers okay', 'well heres the deal if she is the one that did call us and definitely she cares enough about you to call us to check on your welfare to make sure you dont hurt yourself is it not fair', 'well because they probably dont know about it you know how police stuff goes will not let anybody get close to the house you know what i mean', 'grant will you shut up for a

they can love you like i said like you got a pretty good job you got a nice car you got some people you got a family that cares about you okay how about your little brother whats he going to think if he doesnt have a big brother to help him with his life', 'yeah there is no relationship like a brother and brother you know that you may want to kick his arse sometimes but you know what hes your little brother i bet you take care of him and you know what he probably he looks up a lot to you you need to help your little brother and turn him into a real man and im not going to do anything silly he is probably the most important person you should take care of just like yourself he is your little brother and your mom and dad and if things dont work out between you and xxxxx hey like i said theres lots of women out there and you can find somebody i know its hard but it sounds like youve got your sweetheart since high school and believe me my heart was broken by my sweetheart at high school too okay whats your brothers name', 'okay if youre not there to do that who is going to be there to help him', 'well sometimes your parents are busy doing other things sometimes its good that a brother takes his younger brother out', 'okay whos going to take care of the dog if you are not there', 'so thats worth killing yourself over', 'what are your mom and dad going to say when they find out you killed yourself', 'yes i would imagine and then who is your little brother going to have to look up to', 'well dont you think it would be better if he looked up to you as an older brother', 'you need to take care of the little problems you have which are little they seem big and the big picture little nobody has been hurt and nobody is going to get hurt a lot of people depend on you okay not financially but a lot of people depend on you mentally physically and emotionally', 'your brother is going to need help hes going to need help growing up okay your mom and dad are going to need help too you know your dad did 20 years in the core and now he is still working hes going to retire soon and he is going to need your help and i can assure youve got a lot to live for and if you kill yourself youre just going to upset a lot of other people and thats not going to do any good grant why dont you to put that gun down and come outside', 'definitely they are not going to come in thats why we are asking you to come out dont you believe if we were going to come in we would have come in a long time ago', 'okay all right hey everybody has a little bit of an anger problem and how to control it okay the problem is that you are getting angry and pissed off with everybody okay and if you get upset and hurt yourself or shut yourself we dont want that to happen okay we could help you well make sure you get some good help okay we have an officer who is trained in the mental health thing hes got a nurse that rides with him hes working right now and i guarantee well make sure that you get in to see a good doctor tonight all right well get the help you need that you get the counseling and you could help alleviate with these problems okay we all have problems believe me we all got problems the good thing is you havent hurt yourself you havent hurt xxxxx you havent hurt anybody else and i dont want to see you hurting anybody like killing yourself or hurting yourself there are still many people out there they care about you okay and appreciate everything that you do and if it was xxxxx that called she called because she cares about you okay not to get you in trouble she cares about you', 'well i am not im on the phone with you okay if she is not going to pick up the phone theres not a lot we can do with that okay youve never hurt xxxxx before have you', 'okay what if she contacted you first we can take care of that thats a minor thing the thing is you havent hurt anybody nobody got killed and that kind of things and i dont want anymore of that kind of stuff to go on i dont want you to hurt yourself i dont want you to hurt anybody else its not worth it okay and your birthday is in a couple of days youre going to be 21 its legal to go out and get a drink you dont have to find someone to buy the beer for you or go to somebodys house you can go out with your friends youll have a good time think about that', 'what im telling you grant is theres a lot more to live for rather than killing yourself and dying okay remember your parents your kid brother and your friends they care about you and obviously xxxxx cares about you too i just got to know theyre trying to get hold of her i think shes talking to somebody on her phone or something like that they are trying to get a couple of breakthroughs', 'all i want you do is i want you to think about think about all the good things they guarantee the good things are going to outweigh those bad things million to one', 'its because i think as soon as i go outside i will have guns hold on me even if i dont walk out there if i go out with my hands clearly in the air naked i think that there is a dozen guns pointing at me the dozen would scream at me to get down on the ground theres dozen with their dogs barking and then even when they trust me i still think theyre going to take me to vista', 'okay ill tell you whats going to happen everything going to vista you know that you know how the rules are we have to make sure that youre not armed okay but we will not take you to vista well take you to get some help like i told you i have been telling you that and telling you that were going to take you to tri city hospital to get you the help that you need okay thats what its all about', 'i dont know i cant say yes you may end up in vista but again you may not okay the thing is there are no major new charges against you the violation of the restraining order all you need to do is show the page xxxxx contacted me weve been contacting and everything like that were not going to worry about that what were worried about is your health and your safety were worried about getting you out of the house safe get you the care you need so when your parents come back from skiing they know that youre okay

and knees and as long as you comply theyll come up and handcuff you all right and yes you may ride on the back of the police car or they may put you in an ambulance and well get you to one of the medical facilities thats it not to worry about that okay you want to ruin your parents many vacations you dont want to ruin your friends holidays i dont want to ruin your holidays okay', 'a lot i have

little brother think about friends they need you your parents need you okay and if things dont work out between you and xxxxx theres somebody else out there probably', 'we are not going to come in weve been waiting for you to come out', 'well when life gets tough you have to man up sometimes and pull your neck and take care of your problems', 'okay you dont have any good reasons i think you should come outside well get you the medical and clinical help that you need you got so much to live for man so much to live for you havent even started living youre only 20 years old tear it up

your safety once you get out of that bank once you take off in that car', 'not really because there are just too many people around and and i dont know what youre gonna do i really dont because now youve been cooped up in there all afternoon', 'and then both of you can live and both of you can live theres no sense in you killing her or you getting killed yourself', 'no we are not that expendable

continue that', 'okay well no you know just so long as as you know were comfortable working with each other that we want to continue in that vein okay in terms of of when they get here do you want me

then theyll all come all of us come', 'that thats the agreement we originally made', 'its the truth im sending in that tape now these women if they were to come out to you right now you know knowing how so far weve been dealt with weve been dealt with straight across the table but there is some shadow there you know theyre not going to trust you until you have ultimately shown beyond a shadow of a doubt you know that you have kept your full end of the bargain so you know its its like its like what youre asking me to do is youre asking me to use my influence', 'you said that we would play this thing on national', 'and then we would you know all come out and i told you i said well look ill go ahead and ill send a tape and ill send you out two more children and you said thats fine and then you said well play it on krld and you didnt say anything about well play it on play it on krld and then well send everybody out you didnt say that and so you know now youre saying something different

honorable way out tell me what you mean by honorable way out', 'ill have to stay with what i started with and that is uh to its very simple as far as i can see it it and when ill trade <prisoner_last_name> for the women', '<ht01_first_name> you still got 13 people out there we gotta have a a show of good faith so theyll trust me so i can bargain with them im im your representative im you over here not on the plane im representing you ive got you talk about honor weve got to do it honorably theyve got to know that they can deal with me honorably and that i i have enough and you have enough confidence in me that were gonna be able to do what we say we do and the first step is to let the women go then you still got the men you still got all the bargaining power you need', 'you have my word that as soon as <prisoner_name> comes here that the women will will be able will be set free', 'all right didnt you understand that we had talked to <prisoners_middle_name> gone over all the evidence with him photographs statements [losses] tag marked money red dye the whole smear the whole nine yards and that <prisoners_middle_name> had agreed that the only reasonable alternative was try to cut our losses minimize the time go ahead and and enter a plea and uh get some police on this ivestigation get get your parents in here to talk to the judge things of that sort cut our losses

a workout or do you have to be in better condition for that', 'ithink you have to be in a hell of a lot better condition and i think a lot of the moves in martial arts are stupid like kicking somebody in the head is comparable to reaching down and punching somebody in the toe brings about as much sense', 'well can a good boxer take a good karate man', 'easy easy', 'really', 'sure thats why they only allow like if you watch those so called kick boxing matches they make uh the guys they have a mandatory number of kicks they have to kick per round thats so the boxers dont kick their rear', 'really', 'yea no karate man see hes got gloveson you cant youre youre main thing with karate is maiming anything other than that its its youre open youre open to get tatooed by a dozen a dozen hooks or whatever from the other guy kicking wears you out', 'how much difference is there in size can a big uh a little karate guy take a a big boxer er', 'no no way', 'can a big karate guy take a little boxer', 'in a street situation id say yes but in a in a ring it depends on if the karate man had any uh boxing training if he had enough', 'what if hes just a good street fighter guys been raised in

all went down the wrong way', 'no not at all our plan was much different than this', 'ive accomplished absolutely nothing', 'dont give me that bull fighter for the cause they think im a mad man [laughs]', 'i disagree with that', 'well i know what theyll probably portray me as and thats their problem i wont be here to have to deal with it', 'but what they portray you as and what people perceive you as are completely different things', 'well it it [sighs]', 'but chaos is a solution the random factors of the solution', 'but chaos only works when theres leadership', 'no chaos works without leaders thats why its chaotic thats why it cant be traced the anonymous act cannot be traced', 'but theres no direction no uh', 'there need no be if everyone is a leader', 'but its constant chaos at that point you need', 'thats the idea', 'but in effect how does that help the people', 'it uses up the system', 'well i guess thats one [inaudible]', 'it will be used up my life will be used but it will continue on it will be used up and if theres a here after ill be wating', 'are there people here that you deal with all the time that know what youre goals are and', 'i would be a fool to answer that and you knew that', 'well im just im really trying to to shed some light on the whole thing and where youre coming from and what were going to do here so thats uh', 'there isnt much time

would trust him', 'what could we do i mean you trust him to what degree', 'to bring my dog to me', 'i told you i intend to terminate myself', 'well i think all of those people would feel the same as i do that', 'look i had all of those people here last night if i intended there were people walking down the street if i intended to just randomly waste people i could have easily that was not my purpose', 'well uh uh', 'would you', 'i would go in if someone had gave me their word and i knew that they had been consistent in the past i was consistent', 'well thats only one time i dont think you can really say thats consistency', 'its consistent enough', '[laughs] are you do you thing i am totally crazy giving up the weapons i have nothing i cant even terminate myself', 'i still think that we should look at this as where were gonna go with the future not where were gonna end theres a lot to the future', 'im going into the dirt i would like my dog to go with me', 'that kind of a position well nobody knows who you are', 'well i dont intend to hurt anyone except myself and i dont intend to hurt my dog other than i know he will only be loyal to me and nobody else will care for him like i have', 'i have', 'now youll have to figure that one out', 'well', 'i have enough believe me i could rip this place apart', 'well if they want to come in and try to take me thats fine im im gonna do myself in so thats unnecessary but if they want to battle what the hell a warriors way to go is just as fine a way as any other way to go i dont want to hurt anyone i did but i have decided that just out do it', 'i think youre being too hard on yourself <name>', 'no i wasted it', 'i cant do anything for anyone now', 'why not', 'its all over i told you i lost my viability', 'i just flipped out no i flipped out thats it thats the madman thats a deranged person my viability went down the tubes', 'well ya know i i know this is your job to try to con me but it just', 'no im not trying to con you', 'it just doesnt work', 'wait now lets get that straight right now', 'well you tried to con on <name> not being dead i know shes dead', 'well they gave you false information', 'i cant be assured of anything anything that you ask me ill try and accomplish', 'well see thats what i mean nobody can be assured of', 'i cant trust anybody right now', 'all i can do is trust myself', 'well youre gonna have to trust somebody else', 'id like to trust someone to bring my dog to me', 'well i told you i intend to die and uh i will i will not hurt anyone that brings the dog to me', 'well', 'well hes gonna be the same way when i go to the funny farm or where ever they wanna take me to', 'but at least you can make some arrangements that you think are are necessary', 'what do you think you think i should just shoot myself or you guys wanna come in and try to take me', 'i dont think we should go in either direction i think we oughtta discuss you comin out and [inaudible]', 'thats insane', '[sighs]', 'im going right [phone_drops_to_floor]', 'hello', 'hi', 'hi', 'this is henry', 'okay henry you want to speak to david', 'yes who is this', 'its rita again', 'thank you rita', 'okay', 'wait a minute had this ear plug again', 'what', 'i said i had the ear plug in again', 'oh okay', 'i keep putting the phone with the ear plug', 'oh okay', 'okay heres the deal', 'okay', 'im going to make this tape now you know some of these younger girls you know they dont want to go you know and i i explained to them i said look i says you know our main thing sarah knows anyway and its the truth you know the truth you know', 'um hum', 'and i explained to them again cause you know they the girls have the different rooms and talked to them but i explained to them i said you know our whole purpose is our message we have a message and the worlds ignorant of what we believe in the bible so theyre ignorant about what were doing', 'um hum', 'you know', 'see thats what they anyway im sorry i didnt mean to get off the track', 'okay', 'heres the deal so some of the some of the older you know we have quite a few older ladies here too', 'okay', 'and i told them i said look i says you know you all you know you all cause they theyve been quite shocked you know i told him i said look you all you all are not really involved in anything you know you all believe the message and believe the truth i says but remember thats the main thing is the truth is what we all stand for', 'okay', 'and i says you can probably also help present to the people the truth', 'um hum', 'and so you know ive ive been talking to them i said look heres the deal you know you can either witness for god here and probably dont want to listen to us or if you had a chance to to be on the outside you could witness to him there', 'um hum', 'you know cause people are going to want to know why weve done these crazy things now next thing we didnt give them a bunch of baloney but i said you know youre the ones that are supposed to be the victims so you know if youre out there you can do a greater witness for god you know being out there to show them that you do want to live cause you know a dead christian is a dead christian', 'right', 'a live christian is a witness', 'um hum', 'so you know and so i explained to them you know if if if you all can you know realize that see the thing of it is we dont teach that america has to be punished we teach that god grants unto men an opportunity to see his mistake in the light of gods word and then repent of it', 'um hum', 'you know and so thats the whole thing so this this is where me and jim had a good relationship on the phone because you know i began to explain things to him he like you is an excellent listener and he began to realize that were not trying to be just radical idiots you know with ragging our head off you know talking about armegeddon and stuff', 'um hum', 'you know armegeddon is the prophecies tell you is an end of time when god resurrects all the people that have ever lived and they attack the city of god ezekial talks about it so you know anyway its not a few handsful of maniacs trying to fight thats not armegeddon at all', 'okay', 'but anyway so the thing of it is is that you know theres theres you know theres three of them here that are you know deciding on you know whether you know they want to go or not', 'okay', 'and so im talking to them a bit more now but so it appears to be like i say i told them what what you promised to do for us you know for us which is for god right', 'um hum', 'because youre doing it for our god', 'um hum', 'you know for our belief in god', 'um hum', 'and and so therefore you know this is the whole reason for the truth anyway is to is to be able to have what we believe known', 'okay', 'these people can decide better and then you can ask us questions if were alive', 'right', 'and if were gone then you know no no good i agree with you guys you know two children thats the

rolling and well both reach our goals okay', 'okay well ill', 'now', 'ill tell them that', 'okay now what i want to do is i want to to get your tape as soon as i can one of the things that were considering because a lot in terms of radio prime time is when the commute is on okay', 'the what now', 'when the commuters are driving to work is when prime time is on radioland okay so youre working on the tape and should have it for me soon is that correct', 'well if i if i get a chance to keep making it', 'okay', 'but prime time i thought was the time the people are driving home when they get home in the evening', 'well', 'thats prime time', 'radio i think is is when everybody is going to work dont you think i mean thats when everybody really listens to the radio', 'well thats thats not really ask ask the producers and theyll tell you opposite but anyway like i said youll be playing the dallas one first right', 'were going to play dallas and then we hope to go to national right

'okay he wants to talk to you', 'hello', 'how are you doing', 'kind of weak how are you boys doing', 'how do you feel now', 'how do i feel now', 'um hum', 'just a little pain', 'well like i was telling jim you know i told jim to to look into that bible i told him to look into revelation 4 and 5 i told him to look into those seals now if you look at the the fifth seal if you look at the sixth seal if you look into isaiah 13 if you look in joel 2 if you look into the back of nahum whats fixing to happen has already been foretold i teach seven seals now whatever that means you know id like to talk with you guys in full id like you to grab a bible sit down and follow me word by word see what the ancients have foresaw and that way wed have a better understanding but i realize that you know most of you are not ready for that youve got your own way of doing things', 'look', 'oh im definitely a family person', 'look henry', 'youre not going to listen to me are you', 'i will listen to you', 'okay youre listening now', 'yes i am', 'okay the event that youre now fixing to witness is youre fixing to see a government a government thats been blessed see there was an ancient empire called babylon', 'um hum', 'land of the chaldeans and before babylon ruled the then known world god had a people that he brought out of egypt and god had given them laws and statutes and god had stated unto israel which was a cult because they had one leader moses and one right hand man aaron and god says and promised that if they will keep his laws hell make them the head of all nations if they break his laws hell scatter them amongst the nations and the nations of the heathens will rule over them so for many many hundreds of years god forebores his people but finally the days came when israel became worse than the heathens so god arose prophets such as isaiah hosea obadiah malachi zephaniah habakkuk you know these prophets nahum and god foretold in these prophets how that theyd be scattered amongst the nations in the book of daniel daniel was shown while under the chaldean captivity he was shown that the nations of the earth that shall rule over gods people will be symbolized as one great image and the image will be head of gold arms of silver belly of brass legs of iron feet part of iron and part of clay and daniel says to the king nebuchadnezzar the highest ruling position of the land in that day daniel says thou oh king of this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and yet a third kingdom of brass and then a fourth kingdom dreadful and terrible it shall cometh the whole world', 'um hum', 'and then there shall be a kingdom that shall be at the ten toes partly strong and partly broken so when rome split up under the nomadic kingdoms it fell into many different kingdoms', 'um hum', 'we know it as europe now daniel goes on to explain that while europe is still in existence he goes on to say [indiscernible] behold a stone came and smote the image in the feet and they had gold and silver and brass and iron was all made as the chaff of the summer threshing floors well this stone is the subject of which the book of revelation talks about it talks about that which must be hereafter that god will one day in the future in the end of the world shall come and sit on his throne in heaven and therell be one question asked in heaven the question is who is worthy to open this book the book is in the right hand of god and to lose these seven seals thereof scripture clearly teaches christendom that no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open and he looked thereon', 'um hum', 'but the lamb the lamb is symbolized as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns you know god creates things in seven days doesnt he', 'um hum', 'okay theres only one many who knows what that book teaches but for the sake of humanity the acid test revolving around the subjects in this book revolve around christ in heaven opening the seals and what is witnessed is a man on a white horse a man on a red horse black and pale dead souls under the altar described to god because of their blood thats been shed and then the time when the sun and moon and stars will be darkened the heavens will part as a scroll and the great man mighty men free men bonded men shall cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb but the great davids wrath has come', 'um hum', 'so these subjects are mysteries cause nobody really has a real thorough opinion to really know the real meanings of these things but in chapter 10 after the student of scripture is read and become familiar with the symbols in chapter 10 after talking about an army of 200 million that overthrow the world it talks about a mighty angel coming down from heaven and he has in his hand a little book and its opened and seven thunders are uttered seven thunders and john was told that when theres time no longer this mystery of god this revelation of jesus christ the seven seals will be finished as god has declared to his servants the prophets', 'um hum', 'so in this 22nd chapter after a person takes the time to read these things its very clear the statement christ says i jesus have sent my angel to testify to these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david now ancient david was a great king wasnt he', 'um hum', 'hes the one that took his little sling stone and slew the great giant goliath', 'right', 'yeah okay so what happened was he says behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give it to every man according as his work shall be', 'um hum', 'now when christ comes the question is going to be what did the father give him that no other man in heaven was worthy to receive no man was worthy a book right', 'um hum', 'god gave him a book a revelation of himself that the father claims hes the author of this book and when the lamb comes hes going to bring this book and mankind is supposed to find out that it is the bible the bible which the prophets of god having spoken by the spirit that god gave them having volumed a testament in regards to those events that must be fulfilled in the latter days now in revelation 13 john witnesses in regards to the seventh seal john sees a beast this beast has a head like a lion a body like a leopard feet of a bear in daniel 7 daniel foretold that the empires of babylon persia greece and rome would be symbolized babylon as a lion persia as a bear greece as a leopard and the fourth beast he said would devour all the three beasts before it and conquer the world now that was rome daniel also says in the days of this kingdom they will kill the prince of the covenant they could change gods times and gods laws and place abomination to make desolate false religion we know the only true religion is the religion of god', 'um hum', 'now christ died during the times of rome and on the cross very clearly its written in the gospel records he said father forgive them for they know not what they do', 'um hum', 'and then he said into thy hand i commit my spirit and the hand of god has a book the word by the word of god god made heaven and earth and by his word there was prophets the events that youre now witnessing are taking place now what is taking place well in the book of micah it says in that day they shall gather together and they shall say let thine be defiled that they know not the thoughts of the lord neither do they understand his counsel all of the prophets through the book of nahum it talks about messiah it talks about well for instance to make it real simple christ says he has the key of david in revelation so in the book of the psalms for instance psalms 2 david sees a vision of the future of a confrontation between man and mans law', 'um hum', 'and god and gods law', 'um hum', 'now revelation 13 tells us that theres a lamb like beast thatll rise up having two horns and itll speak as a dragon now weve got to identify what great empire arose up after europe thats a great empire thats lamb like or christian but yet doesnt really tell the truth well the only great empire weve known is the united states of america now back to psalms 2 the psalm says why do the heathen rage you know the heathen dont know god', 'um hum', 'they dont know his word', 'um hum', 'and they get angry', 'um hum', 'it says and the people imagine vain things for the leaders of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the lord', 'um hum', 'and against his anointed', 'um hum', 'thats christ you see', 'um hum', 'saying let us break his bands asunder now what are the seven bands that christ promises to bring when he comes again the seven seals right', 'um hum', 'but zachariah and the other prophets say that the world will not regard these messages of mercy they have no interest in being instructed by anyone but themselves now they say let us break his bands asunder let us cast his cords away from us but scripture says which is taking place right now it says that he that sits in the heavens thats the father you see', 'um hum', 'shall laugh for the lord shall have them the heathen in confusion see the heathen dont know what theyre doing and this time they cant be forgiven because this time they willfully reject the subject which so plainly has been laid in the book of revelation a subject which everyone is to be very familiarized with for the latter days and yet theyre to understand by earnest study that these things will remain a mystery until christ comes again', 'um hum', 'to reveal these mysteries', 'um hum', 'so the heathen and their tactics in dealing with a person based upon rumors and based upon their laws they fail to understand that god also has a law and god also has a kingdom and god also has a key so what takes place it says then shall the lord speak unto them in his wrath thats what happens during the sixth seal', 'um hum', 'the sun and moon and stars is darkened the heaven departs as a scroll and the great men of the earth cry to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the reality that they would not know aforetime what god said will be so they end up fulfilling prophecy not knowing what side theyre doing but to the wise when god speaks in his wrath they already know of the events and it says yet have i set my king up on my holy hill of zion so irrespective of what attitude the heathen may take against the truth of the seven seals or the man that is trying to teach the seven seals irrespective gods kingdom the stone god himself is going to intervene and hes going to hit the image in the feet and its all going to blow away and gods going to take the jurisdiction and power from all the great men of the earth and all that the prophets have spoken is to be fulfilled', 'um hum', 'now the psalm continues to say i will declare the decree the lord has said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee so we know the anointed one is christ dont we christ is the son of god in psalms 2 right', 'um hum', 'and it says the father says to the son ask of me and i will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the earth for thy possession for thou shalt dash the heathen to pieces with a rod of iron and shall break them as a potters vessel now thats pretty bad isnt it', 'um hum', 'i mean nobody wants to be hurt do they', 'no really', 'so thats why in psalms 2 the subject is clear the mission of the lamb the anointed one is to teach the seals okay', 'um hum', 'now the reason why the prophecy is written is because it continues to say now therefore be wise ye rulers of the world be instructed ye judges of the earth serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the son least he be angry and ye perish in the way when is wrath is kindled but a little now im not mad at you guys you know', 'well and were not mad at you either', 'well but your show of arms is definitely bigger than my show of arms so in psalms 18 the psalm has made very plain when it says i will love the lord for he is my rock and my salvation my buckler and the horn of my salvation it says i will call upon him so shall i be delivered from my enemies for they were too strong for me and the day of my calamity and this is a calamity really they prevented me and then it goes on to talk about a terrible event that takes place afterwards because you know you all guys are too big for me you know your laws are more numerous than the ten commandments you know your weapons are bigger your forces are stronger', 'um hum', 'you know but not really you see not really you know elijah in his day the king of israel was having to face the moabites and the hittites and they were outnumbered but what elijah said was they that be with us are more than they that be with them because unbeknown to the forces of the heathen who were so boistering of their superior power they did not see the invisible forces of god the angels of god you know just like in the days of ancient hezekiah', 'um hum', 'when the assyrian armies came into judea they kept saying to hezekiah now do not deceive your people but have all of them come out to me and well take you to a land likened to your own and the land flow with milk and honey dont let hezekiah deceive you saying that your god will deliver you anyway what happened was as hezekiah had listened to the prophet isaiah hezekiah had repented his sins asking god for forgiveness and hezekiah prayed to god saying lord god of heaven thou art the only true and living god and all the gods of the earth are idols and they are no gods now weve come to the birth and theres no strength to bring forth so please save us and deliver us that all the world may know that there is a true and living god is israel so what took place was is that that night the angel of the lord went forth and smote 185 000 of their warriors and they perished you see we all know christ is coming soon', 'um hum', 'that gospels been preached for a long time hasnt it', 'um hum it certainly has', 'yes and everyone is supposed to be like christ arent they', 'right', 'okay but the question is is the world ready for the coming of christ in glory well god never said he would come in glory the second time the scriptures tell us as the gospel of peter tells us look for the salvation that shall be brought to you in the end of the world at the revelation of jesus christ we find in hebrews paul tries to explain to the christian church that we who are of the spirit dwell in the heavenly sanctuary a sanctuary where the man of this world can never contaminate they cannot pollute it they cannot contaminate it because it revolves around god who speaks through his word the seven seals and you know like i say unless we fear god unless we fear his word', 'um hum', 'you know the appearance of the thing just like 2 000 years ago who really believed that christ was messiah', 'thats right', 'you know', 'thats right', 'and why did he have to die he says father i pleadeth that thy remove this cup from me but if it be not removed except i drink it not my will but they will be done taken from psalm 60 where it says lord thou has shown thy people hard things well the seven seals are pretty hard things thou has made us to drink the wine of astonishment psalm 75 messiah is talking to the to the heathen and he says i said to the fools do not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for know that promotion comes neither from the east nor the west nor the south by the north in orion past orion in heaven in the northern part of the universe the father has exalted and promoted christ above all heaven hasnt he', 'um hum', 'right okay it says in psalm 75 were having a lot of babies crying around here now', 'are they okay', 'i guess theyre why are the babies crying so much [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] yeah can you give them some bottle or some some breast or something [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] please yeah she wants some milk okay anyway so were stuck in a corner right now my friend', 'how do you feel right now', 'well', 'physically', 'in psalms i dont know its like this christ says he has the key of david right', 'um hum', 'he can open and no one can shut', 'um hum', 'its taken from the prophecy of isaiah 22 for god promises to overthrow the ungodly of his land hes going to take away the power of the ungodly and reestablish his kingdom', 'uh huh', 'he says in that day ill rise up my servant yeah he says eliakim which means godll raise up eliakim it says on that day ill lay upon his shoulder the key of david and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and it says they shall lay upon him all the glory of his fathers house now unless you know who eliakim is you wont know who his father is but it says you shall lay upon him the offspring and the issue but you know what that is thats children isnt it offspring', 'um hum', 'yeah well thats where you get the first seal at the man on the white horse the first thing that i try to teach people in psalms in the first seal you know the man on the white horse is that youve got a bow right', 'um hum', 'and hes also got a crown right', 'um hum', 'he goes forth conquering and to conquer right', 'um hum', 'well then what happens is you find the truth of that in the 45th psalm [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] theyre on the roof with ropes', 'what', 'theyre on the roof with ropes right now', 'no no', 'the guys are seeing them right', 'no theyre on the roof with ropes', 'no no thats not possible', 'theyre right up there', 'steve like i say i feel so sorry for you guys', 'what we want what were hoping to do', 'i know what you want but you dont understand look at how much look did jim jones ever get this kind of slander look', 'we dont want anybody we certainly dont want you to be slandered', 'listen let me explain again', 'okay', 'okay look in psalms 45 gods the one speaking and when you come up hither to my church see its the spirit and the world the world is bad there is no temple on god to be honest the temple of god must be in you and it must be in truth spirit and in truth okay when you come up hither youll see god on a throne thats whats written isnt it when you read things you dont really see it you just see it in your mind dont you', 'um hum', 'and our mind must be renewed with the knowledge of god correct', 'um hum', 'thats why god has chosen to use scripture as a means for men to see his mind', 'um hum', 'so in the 45th psalm when you come up hither and you can look at the father spiritually and you hear the 45th psalm speak it says my heart see the father gives me the book right and opens the first seal about the white horse', 'um hum', 'so then i show you psalms 45 it says my heart is indicting a good manner i speak of things which i have made touching my king you know who the fathers king is dont you its christ', 'um hum', 'it says my tongue is the pen of a ready writer', 'uh huh', 'now how does god want to speak he wrote a book didnt he', 'um hum', 'thats why his tongue is the pen of a ready writer', 'um hum', 'he says to the son he says thou are fairer than the children of men so thats his opinion isnt it', 'yes', 'he says grace is poured into thy lips now how are men required to be saved in the latter days whos going to come and whats he going to teach the seven seals right', 'um hum', 'and who gave him the seven seals to teach the father right', 'um hum', 'and all that receive his testimony will learn the prophets and all the books pertaining to these seals and theyll receive grace', 'um hum', 'unmerited favor for salvation', 'um hum', 'so therefore have god blessed thee forever but then it says gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in that majesty ride prosperously because of truth now what did he ride what does the king ride in the first seal what does he ride', 'the white horse', 'he rides the white horse', 'um hum', 'so theyre on the roof for sure now right', 'well why why are people jumping all around on the roof', 'there is nobody on your roof there is nobody there is', 'lets get back to the psalm then so you can get a better picture of the way i think okay so in psalms 45 it says with thy glory and majesty ride prosperously because of truth now what is the truth that the father gave him that says hes going to ride prosperously the seven seals right', 'um hum', 'okay meekness and righteousness it says thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things why because the father gave me this book', 'um hum', 'the father gave me the book and it talks terrible things whats going to happen to the heathen that resist resist against the will of god the word of god', 'um hum', 'okay finally it says thy arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies i mean you know what arrows does he have a bow in the first seal he does doesnt he', 'um hum', 'okay whereby the people fall under thee this says thy throne o god is forever and forever the [indiscernible] is a right scepter thy love is righteousness and hate is wickedness therefore god thy god have anointed you with the oil gladness above thy fellows so is christ the son of god', 'yes', 'and hes god isnt he', 'um hum', 'okay now it goes on to talk about his marriage it says upon my right hand is stand the queen in gold of ophir', 'theyre coming in on us', 'go up and see', 'well if you [end_of_tape_10a]', 'cut our lines off so i cant talk to the radio programs theyre telling people that im not communicating with them and the reason being is you all cut all our lines out', 'did did was somebody working on

2 weeks and then we send them away', 'um hum', 'the reason being is is that by sending them away theyre able to get out of our influence and get under other peoples influences', 'right now what', 'and then they can', 'what about what about the men are you going to send them out one by one in the same fashion', 'well how do you want it', 'yeah thats thats fine', 'i mean you know definitely the you know the men are more dangerous then the women so difference is you know the the i mean like i say i was just concerned', 'okay', 'on how you feel in regards to whether theyre wearing coats or not i

because like i say theyve studied for years', 'um hum', 'and even though theyve studied for years and at one time they may have been real bright you know when when theyve learned this message a lot of it goes over their head', 'sure sure', 'and its just a part of the human decay of our', 'thats right', 'minds and our brightness', 'exactly', 'okay well good good im glad you know that you chose them you know to be the', 'well no i asked them', 'okay well good', 'you know and i i told them i said look i said heres the deal you know so far jim has been real good and so far this guys been you know

'well i know but you know once we [indiscernible] you know and we gave you our word that it was going to be in a certain fashion when you kept saying theres somebody on the roof you know somebody with a rope and stuff like that', 'well there was it wasnt a it was it was our guy', 'uh huh uh huh', 'so he got scolded for that because you know', '[laughs] yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense', 'it was our fault you know', 'yeah', 'okay', 'that way the two children get to speak to their mother', 'okay thats fine', 'thats fine we can do that', 'i mean jim im sorry with jim', 'okay thats fine thats not a problem we can do that', 'okay then im going to im going to turn the radio on here for a second im going to shut my eyes just for a little bit so i can regenerate', 'okay

you agreed to play this tape right because you really have no intention of playing it right', 'i told these people to trust you all', 'okay now heres the deal though you know you do understand the importance to us for this what i have to say to be gotten out now were not terrorists i mean youre not and we dont have no hostages here', 'i understand', 'i mean the children thats kind of like a hostage cause like i say theyre too young to make their decisions', 'um hum', 'and i dont i dont agree with that even if theyre my own see so the thing of it is is that like i say ive been faithfully sending them out not just because im trying to to to buy time but because i just dont want them involved in this', 'um hum', 'you know and trying to to walk the middle of the road to make it as fair for us you know and as fair for you but actually on my side im going to make it fair for me first just like your your side youre going to make it fair for you first so you see we both know where were coming from on that area youve got me okay like you say you know were sitting here listening to the radio and everyone on the radio keeps continually saying you all are going to storm us you all sent you sent you know this is what theyre saying now im not saying that thats true', 'okay', 'see so youre being if youre honest and youre being dirty dealt with just like i have been dirty dealt with you see and its a different situation but still its the same thing', 'well', 'theyre saying that youre going to do something and its going on national radio state radio at least and people are out there listening and youre not correcting it you know and theyre saying well the fog is a good cover and this is going to happen and and weve seen these many vehicles and theyre moving up and and you know well youre not youre not getting on those boys saying now wait a minute you know were not doing that no theyre theyre incessantly tormenting us you know and theyre telling us what you guys are doing', 'exactly but one of the things that weve been doing is weve been ignoring the press because we dont want the press to know what we are or are not doing you know and thats why we havent said anything one way or the other', 'all right', 'thats why the press doesnt have the correct story because were just', 'but the press', 'not talking to them', 'the press you know you all pulled them back because you know they feel that when you all come in here and and bang us all up and everything that you dont want them to get it on footage', 'yeah thats true', 'and thats in your favor i agree', 'okay', 'okay', 'you know', 'okay lets do this', 'see there were', 'look look theres one thing that binds us all here together', 'um hum', 'um hum', 'to barter someone elses decision to deal with the effects of what we have believed in because you all fail to understand what were believing in the constitution watch the baby please in in written form though theres many interpretations constitutional law says that we are to have religious freedom for religion but of course it has quotas to where weve got to define what religion is and is not acceptable', 'um hum', 'okay now we do condone a bible religion but then there comes in the aspect of interpretation so someones interpretation could be wrong and therefore making their religion wrong and if that religion hurts others if it confines others or binds others then definitely we have to take a stand and present it to the public so that the public which is our judicial system realistically can decide that well no this is incorrect and we have to in means deal with the person thats going contrary to to what the person is saying the scripture says you know people can screw things up and that religion is a false religion for sure', 'um hum', 'um hum', 'now thats when i had to stop and think now what does he know that i dont know i didnt know donny joe harvey or orville wells yet i didnt know that george was involved in coke and also in methamphetamine i didnt know those things then', 'um hum', 'so you know why the system did not well like i say this is a lot of water under a bridge', 'right', 'but it did make me look bad and the thing of it was was that the weapons that we purchased which you can look on all the yellow sheets at that time everything we had was with a yellow sheet', 'um hum', 'everything we bought was with a yellow sheet everything youll find that those things were bought locally and also in from palestine there were basic rugers you know and stuff which at that time was considered you know a rodent gun you know', 'um hum', 'of course we know that the 5 56 is also a military too', 'right', 'but anyway the thing of it is is that it gets blown out of proportion', 'right and i think one of the things that were talking about and what were trying to resolve here is is that everybodys either fears or concerns about what might or might not happen i i think that what your concern is your main concern is that we might attack you okay and', 'well if you attack us it just comes down to this', 'okay but were not we have no intentions of doing that', 'i know but it just comes down to this though you end up killing us', 'okay and our concern is that that', 'and then youll have a story the way you had it youll theres no theres no media around us', 'well we dont', 'youll say that we attacked you and this that', 'no our concern is that youre not going to come out and that you might commit suicide', 'well', 'um hum', 'you know [indiscernible] we will not be careful in answering this to you king we will not bow down to your law which goes against our gods law well the acid test came they threw those boys in the fire didnt they', 'um hum', 'but who protected them god did now were in the fire now not a real fire and like i say we believe that america is a great nation and that it like assyria or nineva of old can hear the message of jonah and it can have a chance to say hey you know this this what this guys teaching out of the book is straight out of the bible its in harmony its perfect maybe theres been a misunderstanding here', 'well what if we can go back and clarify our agreement so that you feel comfortable', 'right', 'let me let me talk about this with with some', 'no no come on', 'come on', 'look', 'oh henry', 'um hum', 'how many times has the federal government', 'im just thinking about all the past cases of where the like i say we both know what im talking about', 'whatever past cases ive had', 'but this is our case this is our case me and you are talking and', 'exactly exactly this is you and me', 'okay', 'and and', 'so youre worried about me committing suicide all right', 'we dont want anybody committing suicide', 'okay', 'well how cold is it in this room', 'i understand that', 'low forties', 'yeah', 'well', 'thats what we were working out now youre twisting up again', 'no im not', 'we will and thats exact', 'and i told you', 'thats exactly what were going to do', 'okay let me like i said finishing this tape is being dragged out now too so', 'okay', 'let me ill have to ill have to get with these you know especially some of these girls and talk to them', 'well as soon as i get my tape finished', 'im not you know im just asking you if you will consider doing that', 'okay', 'you know and like i say these people know the seals and they know that unless this country observes and sees then they know point blank whats going to happen according to the prophecies thats why our main burden is holding out here until we have an opportunity to state our cause you know what did nicodemus say he says did our law judge any many before the hearing were talking about the jewish law which is law of god now we know the law of man does but you know thats where me and you we kind of kind of have a little friction because i want to serve your laws where they coincide with gods laws and america does above all of the nations it does you know its the closest to gods laws basic principles of common sense you know but again there are some laws in the scriptures of truth which are the laws of prophecy you know and these laws are great laws because theyre additional to the ten commandment law such as the law of forgive them father they dont know what they do', 'um hum', 'see now thats a law you have to forgive people based on their ignorance', 'okay', 'now the next law which lets say the ten commandments is christ right', 'um hum', 'so the 11th commandment is forgive them okay so every man that that does err we have to forgive him cause they dont know what theyre doing', 'um hum', 'so then the 12th law will be into they hand i commit my spirit which means like isaiah 51 says when god says hearken to me you who seek after righteousness you who seek the lord look to the rock [indiscernible] you know god is that rock on that throne isnt he', 'um hum', 'and it says behold my people give ear to me oh my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light to the people and in that judgment that law is christ coming the seventh seal', 'um hum', 'now thats why without you knowing where these seven seals are in the bible you know you wouldnt know how to judge me', 'exactly', 'except by your law and i respect that see im willing to come out and be observed and judged by your', 'okay', 'law', 'okay', 'but if you allow me to first speak my law', 'okay', 'okay whats the preamble', 'thats thats where youre going to explain our agreement to the', 'oh okay right okay', 'okay', 'right all right', 'okay so ill call you back in a little bit', 'okay', 'okay', 'okay im going to have to do some adjustment here now so', 'okay', 'okay ill talk to you in a little bit', 'okay ill talk to you bye bye', 'no i dont wanna hear that', 'ok', 'dont give me that hear', 'ok', 'all i want is bring my wife and <news_reporters_name> you hear', '<news_reporters_first_name>',

'yeah', 'to get my strength up', 'oh yeah', 'and what wed like to do is we are trying to not present this to somebody thats thats going to take it lightly but rather whom we are trying to contact as a matter of fact as we speak is the national christian broadcasting network okay', 'all right', 'okay', 'all right okay wheres wheres which where is that located at', 'theyre based out of arizona i think its in i think its in phoenix and they have', 'whats the subsidiary station here locally', 'that i dont know i know that they have several thousand radio stations throughout the country but you know', 'the station everybodys listening to right now is krld right', 'yeah but thats thats local', 'i know', 'were trying to get you something number one thats religious', 'exactly', 'thats thats serious', 'exactly', 'number two that has national exposure', 'okay', 'now the you know as you know that one of one of the concerns that i have is here you are very serious okay and some of these people are calling you i dont even want to tell you what theyre calling you okay i mean its something that you dont like okay so i thought it would be', 'no okay i just i got what youre saying just', 'okay so we want to have something that you know that youre going to be pleased with because its considered a serious religious network okay so we i mean we called this national network in arizona and we couldnt get a hold of anybody so what we did is we called our fbi office in phoenix and as we speak theyre waking up the people that are in charge of this', 'its not a 24 hour radio station', 'well im not sure about that im sure that it is', 'what what', 'i shouldnt say im sure that it is but but the people that we were trying to contact the head people werent around so', 'oh i see yeah', 'so they they sent people out to the home okay', 'right', 'and when i was talking to steve he was a little bit confused about what you wanted so', 'okay were going to make this tape its not going to be a long one', 'okay', 'and were going to put something together very tangible very simple very even and begin to show the difference between the way i perceive the seals and what in in difference to what weve heard the seals being presented thus far by all so called teachers and religious leaders that have been calling the radio stations', 'uh huh', 'so that way people will be able to honestly listen and read their bibles as theyre listening and see that i know what im talking about', 'exactly', 'and then theyll make a decision from what they themselves have seen and heard from their own bible and then like i say then im in your hands', 'okay one of the concerns that i have okay is im talking to some people some medical people and what i dont like what im hearing and what im hearing is that you know remember when we were talking earlier and you coughed okay you told me that you thought that you might be bleeding if you', 'yeah when i cough i bleed', 'okay now do you do you think that youre bleeding internally probably right', 'well the hole is right here next to the belly and it it hit me in the the pelvic and then it somehow traced around and went out kind of towards my back there was a hole in the back', '[whispering] my god', 'that was bigger than the hole in the front', 'yeah well see', 'and then the', 'well i was in shock when i first got hit i thought', 'okay', 'but like i say when im going to make this tape and and im going to when we send the kids out to you im going to send that tape with them and youll just have to this will play this will play tomorrow sometimes right', 'well we can play it whenever you want if you want we can play it now or we can we can go', 'well', 'you know we can play it tomorrow tomorrow will be fine now you know if you have a problem if you have or if youre not happy with the national christian broadcasting network we can go to krld i mean i dont have any problems going with whomever you want', 'well thats like i say if its a national coverage then other stations will pick it up', 'sure', 'and krld will probably more than happy want to play it because theyve theyve been wondering whats happened to me anyway', 'okay well i dont have any problems making them a copy and giving them a copy or whatever youd like', 'would you would you make a correction for krld and then those things for me', 'okay', 'lets see they keep saying we have eight kids out lets see we got 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 children and they need to they need to understand we got 16 children out', 'okay', 'and theres a whole lot more as youll find out

god and for the testimony of jesus christ which no doubt are the things jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the pharisees and sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on a lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia which we do see clearly in the scriptures', 'david', 'yeah', 'that sounds pretty good', 'like i say its the the way you know if youll hear between it kind of breaths and pushes', 'um hum', 'and i tried to make that you know like i say i tried to make it as clear as

to bring this', 'im aware i realize', 'im not no', 'no i want this to i want', 'if we take a look at the record of john the gospel writer john take chapter 7 we see in scripture john writes that after certain events after these things jesus walked in galilee he would not walk openly he would not walk in jewry would not walk amongst the jews because the jews sought to kill him we might wonder why wasnt christ such a good man now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that they disciples also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if though do these things shew thyself to the world for neither did his brethren believe in him strange statement isnt it its funny how that when men live and have to deal with realities of life that even a man like christ could have to meet with unbelief even from his own brethren then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready and im sure most fellow bible students will agree the time referred to is the time of his crucifixion they wanted to kill him and he didnt want to show himself openly then jesus said to unto them excuse me verse 7 the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret you would wonder why a man like christ would have something to hide i mean surely the angels would protect him obviously i personally think a lot of things about this strange character and disposition of character but were sure in being christian that christ knew what he was doing [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he', 'well can you let them find out if they see the stretcher if they took the stretcher out', 'and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people', 'the truck is here but were waiting to see if they let out the stretcher are you there', 'yeah', 'okay', 'howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews', 'what did you say about the stretcher', 'now we understand the jews at that time had their own religious [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible]', 'oh', 'political network didnt they', 'okay well were sending it', 'and a pretty strongly religious spectrum although they had no actual political power they were subject to the relevant government and thus to the really traditional rabbinical laws now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught and jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned now in the days of israel most scholars and teachers will agree that the schools of israel ordained by the sanhedrin and also the pharisees were schools similar to the ones of our own theological schools of today of which a careful student of scripture observes that no where is it written in the gospel that christ ever attended these schools but at the age of 12 he did enter into the temple and had a most unique and interesting discussion with the religious leaders of which they were quite amazed at such a young lads knowledge of scripture now this man was teaching something no doubt christ that is that inspired the people to say you know how knoweth this man you know letters having never learned they marvelled jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me now what does that mean my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me', 'returning to [indiscernible]', 'if any man will do the will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself now friends people that love the lord this is where we begin to talk about some serious things im sure youre all aware of how how im involved in a very serious thing right now and im sure that a lot of you realize that i should be possibly scared concerned there is women children and men involved in our situation here at mt carmel but i am really concerned about the lies of my brethren here and also really concerned even greater about the lies of all those in this world you know without christ without jesus we have no hope why well because we know that the standard of gods righteousness is a law a law between men a law of statutes and judgments and which god gave unto moses from sinai say this is thy righteousness o israel but you know god also gave another law a law revolving around a system of shedding a poor and innocent lambs blood and that all who would break the law of god who

real good', 'ive already cleared go ahead', 'okay thanks', 'okay', 'okay bye bye', 'okay', 'rachel', 'yes', 'okay is david still listening to the message', 'yes', 'okay all right just hang on here with me', 'okay', 'for they know not what they do [indiscernible] which is a point that were fixing to get into quite heavily father into thy hands i commit my spirit taken from psalms 31 we begin to see that christ is well versed at the scripture just like the gospels tell him when [indiscernible] always referring i guess to temptation by stating it is written it is written it is written now what is this spirit of christ well they pierced his side out of his side came blood and water i get another mystery this became something to do with eating his body and drinking his blood some implements for the church but what do these things really mean well after weve read acts and learned of the power of pentecost the cloven tongues of fire that came upon the apostles who by mercy through christ were given another chance to recover from their falling we learn through romans that there is a righteousness of god in christ declare his righteousness we learn in corinthians i and ii we learn in ephesians galatians philippians oh we have such a wealth of information of such intelligent men who speak sometimes very deep mystical things about a god who is in the form of humanity who is the son of god who sits at the right hand of god in the highest court of the universe', 'keep the kids quiet', 'who promises that one day hell come again well the last living apostle [indiscernible] this great controversy and i might add those who persecuted christ who would not hear him no matter what sign was given also persecuted his disciples and finally we end up in the book of revelation where john the last living disciple on the isle of patmos being a prisoner for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ which no doubt are the things jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the pharisees and sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on the lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia of which we can see clearly in the scriptures that they were given specific and direct messages from christ and in each one of these messages christ specifically told the churches what he would have them to do now we know that christ is the only man in scripture who ever kept the law of god perfectly we know that because weve heard the writings of the apostles but sad to say the religious leaders of his days and the majority of the populace of his days didnt think so its funny how that is its kind of like people always like to build the sepulchers of the dead prophets and garnish their tombs but yet they hate and kill the living prophets only god knows why that is but nonetheless the church of ephesus smyrna thyatira sardis philadelphia laodicea the churches thats involved for anyone to read direct counsel is given beginning with its the age of the church of ephesus right these things [indiscernible] what happens if the best is given and then the decision is up to those [indiscernible] christ each council [indiscernible] even has ear to hear so if you want to know but in here with the spirit [indiscernible] the church finally we get to the 40th chapter of revelation', 'they picked up the stretcher now theyre on their way back', 'and as soon as scripture becomes [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]', 'they picked it up you said', 'yeah', 'and theyre on', 'now theyre on their way back', 'okay okay good can you see them', 'yeah', 'which was referring to the last part of third chapter of the message of laodicea he says after these things i saw and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice that spake to me as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you that which must be hereafter now the question to every true christian is this is john telling us the truth or is john lying to us we know he just gave counsel to the seven churches of asia which were alive and hopefully in good health when he first gave these letters to them but nonetheless they being of asia are know wise the same people of us today or even of the oncoming years thereafter so the events of chapter 4 clearly explained by john that his messenger as sent to him stated that he be taken up hither therefore a door opened in heaven the bible records and he was to be shown things which must be hereafter sometime after johns day now what did he behold in chapter 4 of revelations he says that he was in the spirit he immediately was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and he states that the throne was occupied someone sat on the throne and he that sat upon the throne was like a jasper a sardine stone i [indiscernible] say the scripture knows all the way through prophecy all the way through the bible as far as back as the days of genesis even to the prophecy of deuteronomy 32 where it says god is a rock he is our rock and his work is done in truth and in righteousness all the prophets refer to god as a rock now here we see in revelation john likewise written it says god has the appearance of a jasper and a sardine stone [indiscernible] there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald he carefully saw that there were living creatures around the throne saying that god is holy holy holy which was is and is to come god intended all things for which the pleasure they were and are created now this instruction emphasizes that there is a god a kingdom a judiciary in the respect that john witnesses that there were 24 elders sitting on 24 thrones seems to imply a judgment but uniquely enough in this judgment or in this throne or in this heavenly sanctuary as we see from the rise and fall of the apostles paul only talks about the heavenly sanctuary the heavenly sign in this sanctuary we see a god a rainbow a throne living creatures stating that god is holy which was is and come the past present and future and that this god this creator of all things is holy and deserves to be worshipped we continue on in chapter 5 to see that i beheld john says the right [indiscernible] that sat on the throne a book or a scroll sealed with seven seals notice its written on the inside and the backside well the meaning of these things kind of will be speculated until we have solid proof in other words unless we were there ourselves to see it in detail but what we are allowed to see in the scripture is john also beholds a might angel in this throne room where all these angels thousands ten thousand and thousands and thousands are called together and this mighty angel questions all in heaven who is worthy to open this book and to loose the seven seals thereof clearly scripture states no man in heaven neither on earth neither under the earth of course buried in other words we do have dead in this world you know was worthy to open neither to look thereon so hey god says in scripture at least john testifies in scripture that the mystery of god his book is sealed well what happens is as we continue on we see in chapter 5 that john begins to weep until one of the elders says weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof of which we know the lamb being a symbol of christ is brought to view and john beheld a lamb as it had been slain in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and the elders with seven eyes and seven horns well whats the meaning of these things', 'theyre back', 'if god does have a revelation [indiscernible]

about 3 minutes ago', 'okay and what is your name', 'my name is jillian matthew', 'okay jillian if you would see 85 over 40 is a little bit you know is a little bit of a concern so i would like for you to take it like maybe in another half hour or so', 'um hum all right', 'okay', 'yes', 'okay may i speak to him', 'all right you like to speak to you', 'yeah', 'youre holding up huh', 'yeah but she said it was a miracle', 'yeah yeah', 'i got to like i said you know you got a got a strong will you got a strong will', 'um hum well thats real good were happy to hear that i have a bit of a concern', 'uh huh', 'now wait a minute now youre making a statement youre making a statement which is totally contrary to everything those children with reasoning powers have been taught scripturally youre denying what they themselves have sit and heard day by day so i know point blank that you know you have not asked them in regards to whether theyre going to see their parents again because the whole doctrine revolves around you know isaiah 49 where it says i will save thy children referring to the covenants and you know they they know all of these or at least are aware in conversational wise children that age usually do not have a conscience to discern or understand you know the high points of doctrine or philosophy but no the thing of it is that you know every one of these mothers tell them well ill see you soon so i dont know why youre saying that henry', 'well im not im not questioning you know your word you know i just', 'well i mean how you know by by your statement it implies that youre just making a statement but the question lies is did you really ask them', 'well see for example one of the kids you know came out with a note that says that that his name is joshua and that hes 7 years old and you know it lists all the different people that you know i guess are relatives of', 'relatives correct', 'okay', 'and weve and we asked we asked jim originally we said look jim because we first of all our children dont eat pork', 'okay', 'okay now whether you all uphold that or not we we cannot really guarantee that but come to find out instead of calling the because i understand it may take a day or two in some cases but instead of calling the present closest relative you all you all have gone ahead and put them down at the social place', 'um hum um hum', 'you know and which you know like i say thats kind of really neither here nor there at this point in time you know ive trusted jim i i would think that he would be smart enough not to consider these children you know worthy of a foster home or something like that because that would strictly violate the reasons why that you know most of these women and stuff would be coming out in the first place', 'okay', 'i mean they dont want to be judged or considered that theyre unworthy of motherhood', 'um hum', 'or you know having their children you know because of an incident such as were in at the present time', 'uh huh', 'i mean thats another thing of trust again because like i say maybe thats what youre going to do maybe thats not what youre going to do you know we dont know as of yet like i say you know in my case i realize that you know ill ill never see my children again you know because you know i understand through through many many observations and through much history research you know how the government works and stuff like i say i will dance to the music that i i have played to you see what im saying', 'um hum', 'okay but the main thing is for me to stand up in front of my father my god and to present a truth that he gave to me because theres one reality thats above all realities and that is when the powers that control the universe you know when those other worlds and those other beings out way beyond when they come and communicate to you you know', 'um hum', 'a lot of people have a very elizabethan ideal of god you understand', 'um hum', 'they think gods got a beard and wears a robe and and not a very smart you know its kind of old you know traditional old english or you know god is very high tech gods got computer systems and technology above and beyond what this worlds ever seen', 'um hum', 'i know harry you see', 'um hum', 'in 1985 like i said i had a little visit when i was in israel ive always been a sincere guy like randy will tell you you know if you ever interview randy he knows i used to always tell him as a kid that you know theres got to be a god and all my life ive ive had this calling this you know these anyway but never mind but the thing comes down to this theres a test in latter days and its a test of human intelligence and all that which is human that is not going to use its intelligence i dont mean in regards to bureaucratic law', 'um hum', 'you see remember that two individuals that are into bureaucratic control', 'um hum', 'can cause millions of people to go to war', 'um hum', 'a hothead like hussein and a hothead like oh my mind lets see here the cuban guy castro', 'uh huh', 'see just their their one decision can cause many men to go and lose their lives right', 'right', 'well see you might call that a political thing', 'um hum', 'but it really its its politics is another form of religion', 'um hum', 'you see it denies a deity a sovereignty but still it has its principles', 'um hum', 'its philosophies and its well not theology its i guess humanology [sic] its utopianistic views', 'um hum', 'okay so the point that we finally come around to is this if you were in israel and you was confronted with you know something from beyond this world something that you know confronted you and communicated with you and told you what you must do and showed you things such as you have never dreamed see i used to stutter all my life i was a stutterer', 'um hum', 'i stammer all through school had a speech problem you know', 'uh huh', 'but after that event i never stuttered again', 'uh huh', 'but like i say we have to we have to realize that that in todays world with such modern technology everywhere we we have to look at old truths of the bible', 'um hum', 'in a modern way', 'um hum', 'and the modern way is is computerized technology seven seals what is it you know data program in other words what mind of man can be able to categorize all the testaments of the prophets and put it together into seven categories see now thats technology', 'uh huh', 'and the thing of it is its called wisdom', 'um hum', 'and scripture teaches us that if we fail to be interested in this riddle then the worlds that are beyond our world are going to destroy all those whose attitude have shown that they have not chosen to increase and grow in wisdom', 'um hum', 'see the prophecies themselves may be allegorical', 'um hum', 'they may be just little stories but nonetheless it still is a test', 'um hum', 'you know when youre when youre a little kid and they send you to a psychiatrist dont they put tell you to put these little blocks in this little block thing there and you got to shape up match up the sizes', 'right', 'okay well the same as this last revelation we have such pious and powerful men in the world such power look at the pontiff', 'um hum', 'you notice how powerful that religious man is', 'um hum', 'i mean no one questions the the history and origin of the papacy', 'um hum', 'i mean it killed millions the jesuit priesthood for those who went against its infallible laws the eucharist the catechism all the all the thousands and thousands of newborn babes they found in the catacombs you know and under the the chapels and stuff that they put in the lime pits of course we always thought that the virgin and the priest never did anything right', 'um hum', 'yeah but we find out later that there evil things were being done under a cloak', 'um hum', 'and martin luther rose up against it and how did he overthrow that system with truth', 'um hum', 'a bible truth', 'um hum', 'so today we we have a truth a bible truth but its not going to overthrow just the papacy', 'um hum', 'its going to you know bring all the world into a valley of decision people are going to have to hear it theyre going to have to say to themselves well you know thats right that is right that is exactly what is being said in harmony and that that does agree', 'um hum', 'then theyre going to wonder well i wonder who this guy really is', 'um hum', 'well the thing of it is is that im going to let you in on a secret about christ okay', 'okay', 'anyone that god chooses to place his power and spirit in no matter to what degree that spirit is all have the same spirit of the one and only living god', 'um hum', 'so what im saying is im saying that the spirit of elijah is no more different than the spirit of moses or the spirit of daniel or the spirit of hosea because these men as men can do nothing of themselves because all of these prophets had the spirits of christ', 'um hum', 'so christ did not come in person except he came in the person of his messengers', 'um hum', 'and the power of heaven strengthened these men and enlightened these men and gave these men gifts of knowledge and understanding to speak in behalf of christ', 'um hum', 'which is the true living god the word of god otherwise you know you cant put 2 ounces of faith in man its impossible', 'um hum', 'so anyway', 'okay', 'okay let me get back to this tape and what was what was the question again you was wanting you was wanting to know something else', 'well one of the things that that we have a concern about of course is the kids were hoping and were were certain that we want them to be reunited with their families we can count on that', 'yeah well we realize also and i was discussing it with some of the people here that that you know once we go out theres going to be you know now we realize our butts are in trouble there is some extensive research that has to be done you know someone is responsible for the deceasement [sic] of law enforcement officers', 'um hum', 'you know im im hopefully they say on the news that it shows clearly in regards to when the officers first approached it shows you know who fired first because i was standing right there in the door and i know you know that no fire came from our side first', 'okay', 'you see but the thing of it is is that my only hope would be for that is that is that those those cameras actually were zooming in enough on that front door', 'um hum', 'to show just exactly of course what i heard one guy comment was is that you know somebody saw somebody there with a firearm and so once they saw the firearm that thats a sign to go after it right', 'um hum', 'isnt that isnt that a atf rule or law i mean if if you all walked into a place and a guys standing there with a gun you know i mean thats thats what you got to do you got to draw out right', 'well', 'so thats probably where our problem came from', 'um hum', 'but you know i had my head and part of my body sticking out that door i was actually standing in the door there and i i waved out and thats probably all on film too and says you know get out of here theres women and children lets talk lets go get out you know so', 'um hum', 'you know i hope they', 'well one of the things that concerned us was that one of the mothers said to one of the kids ill see you on the other side so you know we were we just wanted to make sure', 'um hum', 'you see im i respect that very much i i appreciate that you know i thank god for that that you know under the circumstances that you have borne with me', 'um hum', 'you know so this gives the confidence you know because this is a great nation america and it should be you know more considerate and more intelligent in regards to these things', 'um hum', 'okay so now this gives me more liberty to entrust myself in the hands of this system you know for you guys to be able to help drive this situation out of the mud you know this is like a four wheeling truck and were all in it and were stuck you know and we all have to drive this thing out', 'okay', 'and thats what im saying im saying if you guys play right were going to play right', 'okay', 'i do not believe that how this got started was right but i was not going to you know allow after all the things have been said about me allow myself to just stand back and sit back and allow the system to come in and you know push push me around i cant do that', 'um hum', 'you see i cannot have the message of truth to be stifled that that easy', 'um hum', 'but you know you guys you and jim have been very very considerate very kind not at all like you know the aftermath of theres theres a batf video out on you guys its called breaking the law in the name of the law', 'um hum', 'im sure youve seen that of course like i say you know its its not meant to ultimately degradate you but its it just simply shows that people are human okay', 'um hum', 'on both sides so anyway i guess ive said enough and no you you tell the children that you know weve been letting them out little by little to see what you alls reaction was going to be because theyve been saying on the radio all the time that you all are fixing to hit us tonight you know', 'well no we', 'and jims been telling me thats not true', 'weve never had that plan you know we', 'so ive ive been balancing it out on both sides', 'okay', 'because like i say i have to stand in a position to where if you do hit us tonight', 'no', 'youre going to youre going to be guilty of killing little children', 'exactly', 'and the thing of it is is that thats why in the beginning i made it very plain i stood in the door there you know and thats not very fun with a bunch of professionals you know coming at you and i tried to tell them holler best i can lets talk about this i tried to talk to robert gonzales first you know', 'um hum', 'and you know i saw him on news here but i think its very cheesy in his behalf very very cowardish [sic] to be staying out of the light now because he could have and you tell him this he could have stopped all of this', 'um hum', 'you know his conscience is probably eating him up', 'um hum', 'so anyway', 'okay', 'okay im sorry so', 'well thats what we want', 'oh im im still here', 'no i dont think anyones going to commit suicide', 'nobodys going to be coming out playing john wayne', 'okay well', 'i mean have i mean are we letting our children out i mean you know are the children gone do the children look like theyve been abused or neglected', 'no no', 'okay so do they act abnormal except the one child because it was born that way it was', 'um hum', 'a medical misinterpretation you know the doctor didnt quite diagnose something right', 'um hum um hum', 'and it affected the child but are you happy with the children so far', 'yes yes', 'do they look like theyre raised strange abnormal', 'well just like jim said that and and like i say in our past experience together weve seen its been more shadowy on your side than its been on mine', 'i understand', 'i mean ive kept just like the other night jim told me not to deal with anybody else but him and we made an', 'um hum', 'an agreement and then you know another guy came along and and then all of a sudden da da da da da you know he we we he was very forceful and very strong and when someones going to play forceful and strong to me then im going to play forceful and strong back', 'that makes sense', 'you see but if someones going to sit down and say look im willing to give you you know 50 percent of the chips and ill take 50 percent of the chips and well play this card game fair', 'um hum', 'then you know when the chips are all on your side then ill ill fold up you know its a fair game', 'okay', 'and thats thats the way thats the way ive always been its the way ive always taught the doctrine that was given to me', 'okay', 'and this is the way the truth has to be', 'okay one of the things that i you know that i had a concern about and you dont have to give me the specifics on this but you know when weve talked about the number of children that are within the compound weve never had a real good idea and you dont need to tell me that but i feel', 'well ask the children that are there you know of course like i say they dont probably know either but just ask them if theres a lot more children thats all you have to do', 'right', 'thats', 'youre being very courteous but when it really comes down to it youre talking to me agent to criminal thats what were talking here okay', 'no im not talking to you agent to criminal', 'no but realistically thats what it is', 'what im', 'i have violated in all appearances the codes of the united states of americas law thats why now your job is to to deal with my mind and to try in your best ability to come to some feasible conclusion of how we can settle or resolve our problems or differences now because of this situation you know i am the one in trouble youre not okay now your courtesy im being very responsive to because i realize i am in trouble and i realize what the future holds for me even when i give myself up to you you know i dont know to what degree is going on my body right now but nonetheless i dont think i have to really worry too much about that because you know when i give myself over to you i still have to keep my mind on god because you know whatever i receive from the judicial system of america you know thats what i receive', 'okay but', 'and if god doesnt deliver me out of it then thats what i get', 'um hum', 'and its to the lords great wishes', 'um hum', 'but like i say the point is this everybodys going to know the importance of the seals then arent they', 'exactly', 'thanks to you', 'well', 'and thats very commendable', 'and thanks to you too but i want you to i dont want you to look at me as just somebody thats looking to you as a criminal im looking to to ensure as best as i can that you and everybody thats within the compound gets out alive and that these', 'right', 'children have an opportunity and that your mission and your cause because youre so devoted to it if you tell me look this is what i want to do to guarantee all of these peoples lives then im with you ill work with you as hard as i can', 'right well thats what thats what i was telling jim earlier i was telling look jim ive got a plan', 'okay', 'and the first thing i told him was is this i said jim i said look ive been hit and i get ive been getting weak i says ill tell you what you let me just lay here and let me die i says and give these people time to think', 'um hum', 'because i wont influence them', 'right i remember that', 'and i says and once im dead then theyre going to be sitting around here and theyre going to be thinking you see and ill be gone there will be no more influence and that way they can make decisions on their own see thats what i was first telling jim', 'um hum', 'you know and jim says no no no of course the other option is is that if if they dont give us time for the people to make these decisions you know then its always going to stay in the light that well as long as im the leader theyre going to do what i say but thats not the way this program is operated', 'uh huh', 'thats the way it appears you know and its true on that tape i did scream and i did call some people some stupid idiots but if you do the whole story', 'um hum', 'of what somebody had done', 'um hum', 'you dont mingle this truth with people that do perverse sins', 'um hum', 'now theres a reason why somebody just like christ anyway christ called the disciples fools didnt he', 'um hum', 'not that he was hating them but because they had done some foolish things', 'exactly', 'but the point is this what i need to do now is i need to buckle down and i need to you know i had some just a little bit of chicken soup here and', 'okay have you had any', 'oh yeah i had a little bit and', 'okay', 'and i need to readjust myself here and start doing this tape', 'okay', 'ive been going through these different tape machines the the big tape machine we we have some trouble with because it uses a akg phantom powered mike', 'um hum', 'and we havent been able to find it and the guys are kind of worried about turning on the lights in the building in case you know somebody you know how it is you know', 'if you tell me that youre going to turn the lights on you can go ahead and turn the lights on nothings going to happen you know', 'yeah because', 'i can advise the people that the lights are going to go on because were working on something', 'yeah', 'and its not going to be a problem', 'well what happened was that we went ahead and we got a couple of you know of higher quality hand held cassettes and i already know', 'oh okay', 'its got a dolby on it and as long as we have the dolby then the equalization is going to be audible enough to where they can remix it at the studio and play it live', 'okay', 'you know i am a musician you know', 'okay', 'so anyway okay well then ill ill get to this then well call you or youll call me at around 6 oclock then right', 'probably around 5 oclock', 'okie doke', 'okay', 'okay ill talk to you later then', 'ill talk to you then', 'bye', 'bye bye', 'steve', 'yeah okay were right now in the process of going to put him on the stretcher', 'okay', 'so itll

now', 'okay', 'but anyway yeah we got we got a tape going and stuff and its im fixing to start up here', 'okay good i wanted to bring you up to date and what weve done is weve contacted krld', 'right ive been kind of halfway listening to it turned way down but', 'okay and as soon as we get the tape were going to have krld play it okay in addition to them the national christian broadcasting network is going to play it now the the thing that i want to tell you about that is theyre going to play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock you know more than once several times but you know thats phoenix time so were talking about 11 oclock there you know before we before we get it here but were going to give it to krld as soon as we get it and thats going to go over you know their network and im sure other people are going to start picking it up', 'okay let me let me see now so when when its going to first be played at krld', 'right', 'so thats local but its going to be at what time at night', 'no i mean if you want it played more than once well you know once they play it once theyre going to everybodys going to be picking it up and its going its going to be played you know time and time again', 'okay but but the question is is that okay krlds going to play it first', 'yes', 'just because of local curiosity right', 'well not because of local curiosity because you asked it i mean you told me that', 'exactly i understand but', 'okay', 'but when is what time are they going to play it', 'as soon as you give it to me', 'oh i see okay but of course its real its real late now', 'well no', 'okay but thats all right anyway', 'i mean you know like', 'because theyll probably play it more than once', 'like like if we get it at at 5 oclock whatever theyll start playing it then', 'right', 'and theyll continue playing it you realize that', 'okay', 'okay and then', 'but when is when is the national going to play it', 'well they told us that they will play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock but thats', 'in the morning', 'huh yes but thats thats in thats arizona time which means it will be 11 oclock here when you know when you start', 'eleven to', 'until until 4', 'right okay okay', 'now how are you feeling', 'like i said its you know im weak but still i feel better i mean you know i mean physically yes but you know spiritually i feel a lot better', 'people people were saying that they were saying that they didnt think because i was talking so strong and all of that for a while that that id actually been shot but then tonight on the news one of the swat team officers said that he was the one that shot me he he shot me twice so that confirms it', 'well', 'i mean i', 'the', 'i was just i was just looking out the you know', 'the the concern that i have', 'the way there but', 'well look whats the foundation of religion whats man afraid of above anything in the world whats man afraid of by nature', 'death', 'death exactly okay so the scripture says in hebrews that christ died and rose from the grave so that he would have power over him that had power over dead which was the devil and redeem them who through their lives were afraid of death and therefore subject to bondage see some people in religion i mean like the jews back in those days they were so afraid of dying and being punished of god that they didnt really see the real meaning of the law the law was a revelation of a divine nature and they didnt understand the prophets how the law was to be properly interpreted they didnt really look to the animal sacrifices for what it really meant you know killing a lamb is really a dramatic thing', 'um hum', 'you know its sad something innocent has to die', 'um hum', 'because you did something wrong but the but the main key goes way back to cain and abel you know cain didnt want to kill the lamb did he no he wanted to bring his own fruits right', 'right', 'but when god blessed abel and didnt bless cain cain could kill his brother couldnt he', 'um hum', 'so you see this story repeats itself so those who do what god wishes you see according to gods word theyre like abels and those who do not do gods wishes well then theyre like cains', 'um hum', 'so now the question right now between us and you guys was which one was the cain and which one was the abel', 'well', 'you know or maybe we were both one and the same', 'um hum well', 'but', 'i will', 'let me ask you this and when i was talking to one of the ladies there earlier she indicated that theres some nurses in there that may be you know kind of looking out after you', 'well theyve been like changing these weve been using like sheets', 'okay', 'off a bed and wrapping it around tied it up and then it gets wet so then we if i lay still for a while and if i dont laugh i mean this is not funny like id be laughing but', 'um hum', 'you know sometimes you laugh for nothing better else to do but if i dont laugh and if i dont cough then it stops bleeding', 'um hum', 'but if i move a certain way or laugh or especially cough then boy it starts coming out again', 'im working on it', 'additionally you know does anybody in there have a a blood pressure cup that they can take your blood pressure', 'oh yeah', 'you you have one', 'oh yeah weve got weve got', 'dont touch it dont touch it because its you know someone was touching the cord and its jittery', 'oh okay', 'so that what i do is i i always teach with questions', 'okay', 'so i i teach my students i say now look i cant save you you know i am not anything as far as you can see any different from what you can see you know', 'um hum', 'we are not to worship men so ill tell them look this is a ill make them read the revelation of who who gave it to him what reason then when i take them throughout the revelation their eyes are seeing the book their mind is developing pictures so that when we get into the part of the seals they see very clearly the scripture teaches that none but the lamb can reveal these things and i go now wait right here the lamb reveals it he reveals the first seal is a man on a white horse', 'um hum', 'now you know whats so hard about understanding that apparently it seems like hes going to war seems like christ is not only a savior hes a destroyer conquering and conquering except we cant speculate can we of course they agree with me i says now we shouldnt add our opinions because we really dont know the details of this i says look here at the second seal they are given a great sword that they should kill one another i said now why how does that reveal jesus you know christ doesnt teach to kill one another you know he teaches love and turn the cheek doesnt he', 'um hum', 'so we cant speculate here', 'um hum', 'so then when we get to chapter 10 after we begin to read throughout the seven seals the trumpets start in the seventh seal my students are brought to the attention of very strange and weird symbols or omens which again speculation is not the facts', 'um hum', 'now we get to chapter 10 we see that sometime during the sixth trumpet john records and i saw another mighty angel sent from heaven clothed with a cloud and as faded as it were the sun you know and his feet as pillars of fire stood up on the earth and sea had his little handbook opened and he cries and a lion roareth when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now again we dont know what this is all about all we know is that the only thunders we know about is in gods throne the lightning thunders and voices we know when the lamb opens the first seal there is the first thunder but it says john is told to seal those things and write them not but john was told that the mighty angel swore by the god that created all things when theres time no longer this mystery of god will be finished so see my students begin to think about those things what is this mystery of the the little book thats opened whats this mystery of the the revelation of jesus christ and of course the last chapter when we learn about the river of the water of life we know that christ is the lord god of the holy prophets you know christ is the one who from the beginning of time spake into the prophets because he is the word of god', 'um hum', 'made angel or hes the word of god made flesh it depends on what the will of the father really is but the keynote is he promised he says i sent my angel and he says i come upwards with me so then at that point my students begin to realize that the coming of christ has something to do with a message a message that only he can reveal', 'um hum', 'so then i ask them well would you like to learn the seven seals now of course they look at me real funny then dont they', 'um hum', 'yeah see once we get that established about the judgment that only the lamb can reveal these things and when i ask them would you like me to show you the seals i wont tell you but ill show you then they look at me real funny like well hey you cant show me these things and i go well thats right i cant but christ can right well yeah i says well let me show you something here in chapter three of revelation it says these saith he that is holy he hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth i go what is that key of course they dont know and i go let me show you i tell them theres 150 psalms that david of ove [phonetic_sp] wrote the psalms you know', 'um hum', 'and christ is the root and offspring of david isnt he', 'um hum', 'god promised david to christ that one day god would sit on the throne of david in the flesh of christ right', 'um hum', 'and that was fulfilled in christ', 'yeah', 'so then i began to take them to the 45th psalm and i go now lets open this psalm up and lets look at what gods thinking about when you come up here to my church youll see the father sitting on the throne and the reason why he wants to know who can reveal his thoughts is because he put his thoughts down in a book he does this so that we can receive mercy and grace instead of wraths or unrighteousness which is not too righteous so then the 45th psalm begins to talk in behalf of god now i always emphasize at my students stop looking at me theyve got to look at god they got to be in the spirit', 'um hum', 'so then when this 45th psalm starts saying my heart is inditing a good matter you know were looking at the rock right were looking at god whose got the book right', 'um hum', 'and we already know the first seal pertains to a man on a white horse right', 'um hum', 'so whose heart is it davids heart or is it gods heart well the scripture says david was a man after gods own heart not in the same magnitude but nonetheless the same spirit of the future where the son of god was to be made manifest god says his hearts inditing a good matter he wants to talk about the things he has made hes a creator isnt he', 'um hum', 'touching his king', 'um hum', 'and his tongue is the pen of a ready writer so its written in the book isnt it', 'um hum', 'so that we find in psalms 45 that he does write prosperously he does have a bow he does have a crown because of truth now that doesnt mean that when christ comes hes going to come on a white horse with a bow and shoot people in the heart in their heart with an arrow but it does mean that theres a truth that must be made known because the real thing to emphasize in that 45th psalm is when it says upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir now the question is who is that queen is she a literal girl or is she a church nonetheless whether shes literal or spiritual nonetheless love is literal whether we love christ spiritually or whether we love him literally theyre one in the same okay now it says hearken o daughter and consider now whether were a girl or not all of us who have eyes to see should consider in the 45th psalm who god has revealed so that in revelation 19 when the marriage lamb comes its very clear in that chapter who that man on the white horse is and it says that he has a name of course in 19 it says behold i saw a white horse and he that sat upon him had a crown many crowns on his head he takes those crowns off the leeches of the earth youll find in other prophecies it says he has a vesture dipped in blood and his name is the word of god okay', 'um hum', 'so the keynote is that we begin to learn that what the revelation is is its a well look you know you know in a movie when they want to advertise a movie', 'uh huh', 'they dont they dont sit there and give you 15 20 minutes of the movie do they with advertisement what do they give you a preview right', 'exactly', 'okay so if the mystery of god the seven thunders are the seven seals if it is to be finished as god declared to the prophets then found in the prophecies are the seven seals', 'um hum', 'and youll find that in the first seal the truth there is about christ destroying his enemies', 'um hum', 'and the only enemies he destroys are those who are against his truth', 'um hum', 'and thats regarding the marriage which unitifies [sic] humanity and divinity into one mind only gods thoughts are worth anything you see mans thoughts are vanity', 'um hum', 'but gods thoughts are eternal', 'um hum', 'so through truth we learn why christ says in the gospel of john when he says my hes having a fight with the sanhedrin remember', 'um hum', 'and the pharisee says my doctrine is not mine its that which i received from my father', 'um hum', 'so hes trying to tell him its gods book he says now if you continue in my doctrine youre my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free', 'uh huh', 'now you know no ones free today right were all in bondage [indiscernible] arent we', 'um hum', 'so we have to learn these seals', 'um hum', 'of course we dont just learn the seals we do the seals', 'um hum', 'as we learn the seals we do the seals', 'um hum', 'obedience not just hearing but obedience', 'um hum', 'so anyway if you ever get a chance to read the 45th psalm look at it judge it for yourself', 'okay', 'and look at the first seal and see if those things kind of look exactly alike', 'well what im going to do is im going to tell everybody', 'uh huh', 'what my negotiations with you are', 'okay', 'and in so doing everybody will know that when we have done and completed our work then weve done our work and everything and theres no reason to die because like i say the truth is to give life its not to give death', 'right', 'and the whole key is this you know christians in general believe that if they shall serve god they shall be persecuted', 'um hum', 'but in our generation even though sin does abound great is a lot let me say this much though sin abounds greatly more so than ever before', 'um hum', 'the point still is as graced as much more abound', 'um hum', 'remember the seals are not revealed to condemn us or destroy us theyre theyre revealed so that all those who profess christ can come together into one body', 'um hum', 'thats what brings the fall of confusion theres too many organizations professing to believe in one god', 'yeah', 'oh it scares me', 'okay', 'professing to believe in one god and yet theres only one doctrine remaining for us to know to bring us all into unity', 'um hum', 'of the faith you know we cant have faith and and presumption', 'hello', 'yeah', 'whats causing that', 'i dont know it must be your cord somebody must be stepping on it or pulling at it or something', 'right okie doke okay let me', 'now you because of because of the way that you have revealed the seals and and your understanding of the biblical readings i have to assume that everybody thats contained within there', 'theres two plans god always gives two ways out', 'okay', 'you see god see if you had a better if you had a better understanding of the prophecies for instance in isaiah where it says behold for the mountains of fear that brings good tidings', 'um hum', 'its a sad story of isaiah 52 and 53', 'um hum', 'okay but whereas in nahum behold will the mountains it tells you a different story', 'um hum', 'not that the two prophecies do not harmonize but god has a plan like in ezekiel where god says that if i shall pronounce a blessing against a people you know because theyve kept my laws you know then if they shall break my laws that the blessing that i pronounced against them i will take away and if i also curse a nation than it shall be no more that i shall destroy if it turned from its wicked ways then will i also turn from my evil which i have proposed to do and will bless them so ezekiel tells us in 33rd chapter that you know god has no pleasure in the death of the wicked', 'um hum', 'no pleasure', 'um hum', 'so the thing of it is that like paul says in hebrews 6 he says that that therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ he says the doctrine of baptism and resurrection you know hes talking about the simple things you know the very first steps in christianity he says lets go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of these simple doctrines you know the basic things like jesus loves me and he died for me and i must be baptized you know we we do that once right', 'um hum', 'he says for its impossible for those who were once enlightened if they shall fall away in other words dont progress with truth you know peter says be established in the present truth which means if theres a present truth there must be a past truth if if theres like we might believe the message of noah now right', 'um hum', 'but in the days of noah no one believed it', 'um hum', 'they perished because of unbelief', 'right', 'now we may believe the message of moses but the message of moses is over those in his day didnt believe it', 'um hum', 'but you see now we may believe the message of christ 2 000 years ago', 'um hum', 'but of course when it was being given nobody believed it', 'right', 'you see thats the whole thing now today weve got one final revelation of course you know everyone believes in jesus today', 'um hum', 'just like everyone believed in moses in christs day', 'yeah', 'but maybe they dont know that christ like they should', 'youre right', 'so you offer them the seven seals you know and well like 2 000 years ago you know the sanhedrin says to christ we be not the sons born of fornication sure its easy today to accept christ as a virgin birth right', 'um hum', 'but back then the general public view was that he was born mary had had fornication with somebody', 'um hum', 'you know so you know they always see christ as lovely and meek but when you when you read whats going on oh when you read the gospels he could throw over some tables at the church couldnt he', 'um hum', 'he was considered radical by a lot of people', 'right', 'but certain people just pick up highlights of his nature and dont look at the other side', 'um hum', 'so when he warns us in the book of revelation he gives specific counsels to the churches of asia hey the lord dont mess around he tells church of ephesus returning to the first verse there ill take your candle away', 'um hum', 'now if you walk in darkness youre going to end up in hell you know smyrna thyatira sardis they ought to see he tells them that theyre lukewarm hot or cold he says ill spew you out of my mouth who and is that the same christ we learn about on the cross hey you just you just let a man crucify you once', 'thats right', 'and then the thing of it is the guy says im sorry okay can forgive him but then he needs to open his eyes and he needs to learn a little obedience doesnt he', 'um hum', 'okay but the thing of it is if he turns away from you the second time isnt he crucifying you afresh', 'really', 'you would think okay so now by the world turned away from these seven seals just because im ugly or they may think im crazy you know i didnt think were supposed to judge anybody according to flesh', 'really well i think that that youre going to reveal the way to you know to safety for for your people you know and were going to of course afford you the opportunity to make that tape do you think youre going to be working on that very soon', 'yeah im fixing to get on it right now', 'okay well i just want you', 'this is what ive been wanting for the longest time', 'i realize that', 'as you know christ youre supposed to walk in him thats what the new covenant teaches us but at the same time youre not supposed to reject any additional light that comes', 'thats right', 'youre supposed to grow into the full stature of the body of christ', 'um hum', 'and your faith virtue virtue and the knowledge in all his temperance you know like i say were supposed to grow as colossians says', 'thats right', 'receiving the knowledge in him when it comes all the new testament writers if you really read those writings again romans all the way through youll find all of them are talking about one day christ is going to come and reveal seals thats what theyre all talking about about that knowledge of of that god had bodily you know', 'um hum', 'talking about the knowledge of the of the spirit thats within christ', 'um hum', 'so seven seals', 'okay i want you', 'because christ is one body all the prophets and apostles are hid in one body', 'um hum', 'one bread and one wine', 'um hum', 'one truth so you gentiles are were supposed to have an opportunity too in the latter days and were here there now and you know why would why would christ come back as a holy and and perfect person when you all dont even believe in the law anymore', 'um hum', 'even though the law was nailed to the cross wasnt it', 'thats right', 'but you know because the law is nailed to the cross now you take a look at the law and he and he says father forgive them so how much more you who stands down at the foot of the cross are to forgive your neighbor', 'um hum', 'one sinner to another sinner you know should forgive one another', 'thats right', 'but even more so we should realize that that good spirit went into the hand of god and the word theres three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one', 'um hum', 'and thats where we have to really pay attention if we want to win the reward of righteousness', 'um hum', 'to realize it in every generation they would not hear the prophets because like hosea he had to marry two prostitute wives didnt he', 'um hum', 'okay isaiah walked naked and barefoot so did micah', 'um hum', 'i mean god does obstacles like you would never think someone like someone like samson could be a judge of israel could you', 'thats right', 'i mean but you know he went around and messed around with philistine women didnt he', 'um hum', 'and the father says is there never a daughter amongst my own brethren and he says no get this philistine girl for me because she pleased me well the scripture says for they knew not that it was of the lord for lord had an occasion against the philistines you know just so much stuff in the scripture people overlook about the mysterious ways so back at christ in his day he says regard ye amongst the heathen and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days that you will not believe though it be told you and then he talks about destroying the nations by discovering the foundation unto the neck well if you didnt know daniel 2s prophecy about the image we talked about earlier', 'um hum', 'you would never know what it meant in regards to discovering the foundation what is the foundation well the foundation of the kingdom of god is in truth and the truth is in the days of these kings daniel says gods tolerance of the gentile nations ruling over his people is over gods going to gather back the hundred and four thousand gods going to choose the jews because the gentiles are going to do worse to a messiah who comes who comes to teach the truth than what the jews did 2 000 years ago and i would do anything to avoid that to keep that from happening', 'okay', 'okay', 'but but help me', 'so let me get this tape', 'help me understand what your role is you are with respect to revealing the seals is it the lamb', 'well remember the lamb well look in psalms 4 that will tell you who i am', 'okay', 'see psalms 1 psalms 2 remember the anointed one the heathen rage', 'um hum', 'and they say lets break their bands asunder', 'um hum', 'what ties the son to the father the word', 'um hum', 'and what portion of gods word has been sealed seven truths of the bible right', 'um hum', 'okay now the challenge is for anybody in the world my friend', 'okay', 'anybody so in psalms 3 the psalm goes on to say lord how are they increased to trouble me for they be many that rise up against me there be many say of my soul theres no help for him in god but it also says ill be not afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves together against me round about in psalms 4 it says help lord it says hear me when i call o god of my righteousness then it says o you sons of men how long will you love vanity how long will you turn my glory into shame how long will you seek after leasing he tells them he says but you should know that god has separated him apart that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him yes stand in awe and sin not serve the lord with fear rejoice with trembling you see', 'um hum', 'meditate upon your own bed', 'okay', 'now see the thing of it that psalm all the psalms are a dialogue of christ you see the sons of men turn his glory to shame because they dont know where hes coming from', 'um hum', 'you know who has god separated apart thats godly for himself who christ', 'um hum', 'and heaven christ but when he comes again according to whats written with the bands and the seals', 'um hum', 'and the by the book is written of me theyre not going to know what god has already said because theyre not going to listen to what god says', 'um hum', 'only what god says can reveal who we are', 'um hum', 'and either we are with the same wheel of god or were not', 'yeah', 'okay so ill make this tape and that way', 'good', 'people can copy it and they can go over it a few times', 'well im going to have a little chicken soup now i think', 'well like i said you know lets make this arrangement lets get this tape done and what time is it anyway im im upside down when it comes to time', 'its about a quarter after 1', 'oh its already 1 oclock huh', 'um hum', 'well can we start this again at 6 oclock in the morning is that all right', 'well you know there are just so many children', 'i know there is theres a lot of them here but you said you was going to do something for me now', 'yes', 'and i was doing this the way im doing it now to see what kind of trust i could develop in jim', 'well now', 'you know', 'well', 'okay now', 'at one time now you now you do you believe that', 'ill have to be carried', 'well well carry you out', 'okay', 'now', 'okay good', 'okay', 'okay i want to tell you something', 'i dont want you to come in', 'just to show you my good faith is you know we called krld', 'uh huh', 'theres nobody answering the phone there so were sending somebody there', 'well theres one number over the line that can the normal number they wont answer right now so yeah okay so if you sent someone there thats fine', 'um hum okay now are you ready to send somebody out now', 'yeah', 'okay', 'you got the van there', 'everybody', 'thats correct', 'yeah because like unless see what im on

what happened was i couldnt i just i mean everything was getting numb', 'yeah', 'so i finally ended up where im at now', 'um hum', 'and that just that was it i couldnt go no more', 'okay', 'and so you

'okay now', 'towels or sheets wrapped around my holes in my stomach', 'okay now how much time do you want us to give you to make the tape', 'well like i say we should we should have something done by at least 6 in the morning', 'okay', 'is that all right [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] i mean because because see no ones no ones going to want to play it for you know for any

together to where it doesnt because i dont want to sound like [making_panting_noises] you know', 'yeah right', 'i dont want i dont want that could be distracting', 'well i feel a lot better now because youre doing this for me', 'okay', 'its you know one thing about human weakness i used to run track', 'um hum', 'and i used to be a long distance runner', 'okay', 'and the thing of it is is that when you start seeing that final stretch you know and you pace yourself', 'um hum', 'its a mental thing', 'okay', 'then that last little bit of stretch you know you get this new wind', 'um hum', 'okay', 'and except i just drink a little orange juice to wet my mouth but im going to get some chicken soup and we need to send a couple of children out to you now', 'okay', 'because its getting kind

they not thats a lot of glory but ill explain received power honor glory riches wisdom kingdom might oh thats a lot of inheritance there especially the gospel says i received all things my father says [indiscernible] because of truth so what could this truth be some truths in the bible talks about riding a horse prosperously and its truth could it be revelations could it be the first seal maybe a

not be broken well learning gods word and gods spirit this is what makes us become born again born by the spirit acknowledging god well so so a girl believes in god so does everybody else that believes in god so therefore god the father has many children doesnt he christ being the firstborn and thereon everything all thereafter did believe but instead of my father should be my children and thou mayest make princes in all the earth to the person that doesnt really understand scripture this would seem to be a very controversial subject i mean christ never had any wife has to be spiritual i will make thy name remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever well even if it is spiritual we know one thing we the servants of god know that psalm 45 is the very prophecy which must be hereafter according to the first seal but just to make sure we know its going to be fulfilled lets turn in our bibles to revelation 19 just so we can get a better caption of what we are really looking at now remember in the 18th chapter of revelation we know that babylon the great fall she made all nations drink of some kind of wine of the wrath of her fornication now we find that something very bad happened and at verse 23 of chapter 18 no more light of a candle shall shine there nor the voice of the bridegroom or the voice of the bride well the merchants were the great men of the earth it says in verse 23 and for their by thy sorceries were all nations deceived we all know about capitalization we know about advertisement selling something making it better than what it really is and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth you see just because people dont accept the truth in gods word does not mean its not true theres some truth that we might teach could get us in trouble but anyway the first chapter 19 it says and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in the heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power to the lord our god why for true and righteous are his judgments i wonder [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]', 'steve', 'yeah',

cant imagine anybody doing it under these circumstances', 'but in the meantime your dogs cowering in a corner scared to death', 'well i dont think so i think theres a lot of room and you could do a

i can get a six pack of beer at this time of the night', 'every joint in this town is closed tighter than a drum', 'so theres no place that i could get you any beer', 'whats happening is i still aint got no cigarettes and i aint got a six pack thats all im asking am i asking for a lot i aint asking for a truck full of money i aint asking for a squad car full of gas i aint asking for nothing but a six pack of beer and two packs of cigarettes', 'just let me come out and help please', 'okay now try to keep it short because you know the these people are not going to want to play something thats real long okay', 'and you know we we had some initial difficulties about you know how long they would play it but we we really hung in there and and stood up', 'we stood up and said listen you know we want you to play his whole message', 'no editing we we really stood firm for you so i i hope you realize that', 'okay this is what we want to do were the people at the network we like i say we we battled them to get the whole message and and they they said they will do it and its an hour its a solid hour david', 'well as soon as as soon as this is all done thats when i told him that that you know i would i would give all that information out', 'thats what we originally worked out', 'okay well what were oh i understand that and and we trust you and we just want to kind of prepare in advance you know to have some buses out there so we can take you together and you know you know we instead of a bunch of cars and we were kind of hoping that you know you would lead the way you know some of the folks might be scared and', 'well david youve kept your word and so have we', 'and ill tell you our only reason for these questions about the people is just logistical you know', 'so we can call ahead to the hospital to say look we have a man who has an arm wound we have a you know david has a wound in his lower abdomen you know so they can prepare to treat you', 'thats the only reason i mean im not i mean theres no secret behind it and then just to have the number of vehicles there you remember the glitches we had the other day when the car wasnt ready and then the people at the christian broadcast network you know their their position and and you understand the news okay', 'and then also i dont want it to get dark on us and that many people getting ready you know with the children the mothers would take a little while', 'you know you know just get a head count tell her to take a piece of paper just count everybody and that will help us with the buses and then the the other thing is especially important is you know people who cant walk yourself and any others can we', 'well thats thats another reason for us to make these preparations david you know what i mean', 'i dont know i dont know thats another reason not to delay because were going to get the message on and and once it is you know theres no reason for you not to get that medical care just as quick as we can', 'well listen after you walk out of there and your your words going to get out even more im telling you its going to get out even more', 'the truth will get out when when you come out of there even more so just remember that okay', 'well its a big place and we were concerned that everybody in the inside got the word you know and that there wasnt somebody off in a room that that didnt get the word you know', 'all right and i trust you and you trust me', 'all the trust i want all the trust of everyone in there do you', 'okay and make those arrangements because we we want to get you out right after your message is played', 'so you can get some treatment', 'okay and you know how everybodys concerned about money and i mean everybody is has a concern can you do me a favor and can you make it you know like in such a fashion that that in order to avoid their wanting to chop it up or to play part of it or whatever', 'oh i dont have any idea i have no idea but what id like to do is i would like for you to make it as concise and as brief as you can make it so that we can be in a situation where your word will will get out nothing will be chopped off your message will go out as you want it you know', 'we dont need that we what we want is we want you to you were given your cooperation and thats what we promised what we would do so i want to live up to my part of it yeah i dont need your money but i do need [touch_tone_sounds]', 'okay now now listen listen to what im going to tell you i dont know if this van is going to stop in exactly the same place as the other van its going to be real close the only reason that im telling you that is whoevers going to take the kids there you know these are two new people because weve had a changing of a shift okay so', 'but but i mean you know they may be 20 feet back or or 5 feet forward from where they parked before i dont want her to get a concern whoever it is thats taking them there well its they didnt park in exactly the same place nothings', 'going to happen other than what has happened before', 'we want to we want to continue in that same vein we dont want to change anything or or make anything in such a fashion you know and when you kept telling me that there was somebody in that tower or in the roof i knew that there wasnt anybody you know because', 'well he was busy', 'no <name> i honestly dont know i aint telling you no bull i just i dont know no more to tell you than what im told', 'theyre not necessarily the ones who are going to serve it you know a warrant a warrants not the end of the end of the world', 'id like to hear your side of it', 'ok well theyll get you one then thats the law you know', 'well shes busy right now you know you and i can work this out ok because im the one whos going to talk to the <name> for you you know they got me out of bed in the middle of the night and said theres a guy up here hes got a problem thats what im doing here ok so if i got up in the middle of the night let me work on it for you alright you understand what i am saying', 'well let me prove it to you im not going to get up in the middle of the night and come all the way up here from <place> to lie to somebody if i was going to do that i wouldnt have made the trip lets talk about the warrant and and you know a solution ok', 'we get this out of the way and you can talk to your mother twenty four hours a day', 'yes but we might we might need to use the phone to get this authority through so lets lets keep it simple and well handle one thing at a time', 'but that aint what i been asking for', 'if i can talk to her i can probably slighten the problem a little bit', 'well shes shes not the appropriate person to talk to about you know about this kind of situation your mothers not going to talk to the attorney general you know i dont have any problem with you talking to your mother but lets take first things first here', 'mhm mhm see thats delaying what we want to do in getting this getting this thing this warrant handled because the <name> may have to call somebody', 'you know shes been up all night too you ought to give her a break', 'well you probably wont have to go anywhere but you know the reason the reason im talking about the warrant and so forth and and and i know you want to talk to your mother is to handle things one thing at a time get them done you know the right way and then theres no problem telling to your mother but we we just got the one phone here and we are going to do some checking on this warrant so we are going to need this phone in other words we are working together on this thing we are working for you so your gonna have to understand that ok so im if if you need me try to call me and if the phone is busy that means we are calling somebody about this warrant to find out some of the details how we can handle the thing and but if you need me and you can get through to me ask for <name> ok', 'and its important i need to talk to her', 'well i can come later i need to talk to her now my little girl is going to have to come first', 'thats why i need to talk to her', 'dont you think if we handle something in your interest that thats in hers too', 'well i know that but you know we dont know each other to well right', 'and those are some of the things you know that i gotta make sure arent going to happen just like i said im going to help you right if you let me help you', 'you know im not going to bs you ok im going to be realistic with you but on the same token on the same hand you know i id like for us to do something together and thats thats basically regarding the baby there we dont have any problems unless we make problems', 'and that baby is going to be waking up pretty soon i dont know about you but im not a very good babysitter i dont get enough practice for one thing that sure would make things easier for us im talking about you and i if we can get that thing resolved', 'ok how about if we talk about it first so we dont have any mistakes do it the simplest way possible', 'mhm mhm see thats a thats a problem for for ah for some of the people here whether they can trust you or not', 'i know i know that might sound funny to you you know but you and i dont know each other that well and you know ive gotta responsibility that if you know <name> and i talk about this and <name> and i make a deal that <name> is gonna gonna to do what he says ive already promised you im going to do what i say bound by that', 'yes but you you gotta understand that you know we are responsible down here', 'well its better to get it all from you did you ever play that game when you were a kid in school where you pass around something around the table this guy says something to this guy and this guy says something to that guy and by the time it gets around the table its a little different', 'well believe me that happens so so thats why i want to talk to you about it so that they dont lose anything in what they call lose it in translation does that make sense to you', 'if youre gonna do something do the right thing in good faith lets lets help you out too ok', 'well resolve the other thing with the warrant i think you are going to have a pretty good day', 'ok ok <name> let me ill get your <name> for you ok but we gotta i im not trying to cut you off here but i wanna limit the time that you have with her on the phone because we are going to need the phone to take care of this other problem ok', 'why not what what what can what would i accomplish by lying to you', 'well thats basically really what we are talking about here i told im im not going to lie to you and im not it it doesnt it doesnt do any good to do that you know if we are if we are gonna come to an agreement on this thing its gotta be based on the truth you said that the thing you didnt like is you dont want to go to jail well youre not going to jail what they are going to do is book you and thats in one door and out the other', 'yes what what would that that wouldnt serve any purpose', 'first ok well go with well go with your suggestion on this thing well take care of all that other stuff too well well take one thing at a time we proved to each other that we are not im not trying to bs you i didnt come up here to do that i came up here to help you let me get right back to you ok <name>', 'well its just in in best interest <name> is all', 'im keeping my word', 'shes on the way i cant stop her', 'they theyre going out the door right now', 'you see i misunderstood you then you said let me talk to i said that i was goning your <name> was coming up to get <name> and you said we will let me talk to her first and thats when i put you mother on see you and i havent talked that much about <name> you said that that you were lied to because you were going to talk to <name> but you and i you and i never talked about that you understand that', 'and what i wanted was a show of good faith from you you know you are going to have to let me help you if i am going to help you you understand my my situation', 'well that was our deal i thought that that you were gonna have you <name> pick up <name> and then talk to <name> see thats why thats why you know it sounds like im going into details here and i am because i dont wanna i dont wanna do the wrong thing see i didnt understand that', 'well because because youre not doing anything in your own best interest and thats is letting your <name> pick up <name> what do you want to talk to <name> about', 'hes going to get you out of trouble you wont have to go to jail', 'well thats like he said youll be going in one door and out the other one', 'you didnt kill nobody its not that bad', 'what did he tell you said i would have to spend ten days in jail and pay a fine ten days well thats better than year', 'what else you want they did a lot for you theyre getting you out of trouble', 'well youd rather talk to a psychiatrist than go to jail wouldnt you', 'ok well i wanna hug her <name>', 'let me help you out of this situation i know i know that right now it doesnt look that great but gees dont dont get all bent out of shape about it you know we can work it out and remember i said before its a walk through that still holds we can still do that <name> youll be out drinking <name> in the early morning sun', 'that we are still going to get this warrant i told you we are going to get the warrant held that way we still can get it held that way nobody is going to come in there and rough you up or anything like that and and <name> said that you know hed give you a ride down there would you let me prove that to you', 'sure you did and you are if i had an uncle in <place> and i got in trouble he could sign my bond doesnt matter where you live the bond is the bond you know your mother trusts you and shes taking responsibility by signing a bond', 'ok sooner you get down there sooner you get out', 'because i wanna prove to you im a man of my word ok', 'and do it for you too ok', 'youre coming back', 'youre not gonna go to jail', 'i understand what youre saying i dont have control over that what i what ill do is ill do the best that i can but i want you to understand that if it comes out chopped up it has nothing to do with me you know were we', 'okay well okay what ill do is i will i will see how things work out ill do the best i can for you i cant guarantee anything on this because of the length of the tape so please dont be upset at me because you know well just do the best that we can [unidentified_voice_in_background_not_discernible]', 'because theyre good theyre good old ladies', 'no no no no no that has nothing to do with anything if i told you that i was going to do something thats exactly what im going to do you know i i have no problems doing you know this and whatever you know', 'and you know and likewise ive been trusting you okay', 'but the press was saying last night that we were storming the place at eight oclock and i told you we werent and we havent and even when you thought that somebody was on the roof i told you that we were not', 'and we didnt', 'okay now i agree with you on all of these things you know and i love america you know and youll find in my past record that you know im not a bad person in 1988 if you research that so called gun battle youll find out i went plenty of times to the sheriffs department and asked them to come out here and deal with george roden on that corpse abuse thing you know if you research that youll find that out and when i was told point blank that i had to get these pictures and as we were walking out sheriff dixon says now boys be careful you know there are some dangerous customers out there', 'oh look if i wanted to commit suicide i would have done it already now let me explain something', 'we were accused three times this last year of going to commit suicide three times the authorities were roused up by letters from martbro [phonetic_sp] and all that here we here weve been digging lakes in the front fixing this place up from a rat hill hoping that one day we might have this place finished to be able to present it true to all those who want to come but at the same time knowing that as long as there were people who would not look at the truth we could not sit with idle expectation and think that were always going to be able to to have this freedom that weve enjoyed weve never gone outside our boundaries weve done things that are legal you know always suspicion on every hand you know but the thing of it is is that if there is anything in question we need to take it to the bible christians are supposed to take it to the law and the testimony of gods scripture now otherwise we are commanded by scripture to abide by the laws of the land in every degree as long as those laws dont 100 percent conflict with the law of god in nebuchadnezzars day when nebuchadnezzar had that dream you know daniel and them were subject to the babylonian kingdom werent they they kept the laws of chaldea didnt they but when it came for nebuchadnezzar to make that image and he commanded all people to bow to it', 'and we want to get you out of there as soon as possible because you know your blood pressure isnt all that good youre not you know with all those blankets that you have on you you

machine what would you do go ahead now i wanna hear this answer', 'all right because youre not in my shoes', 'no one could ever see if my daughter used to be a fucking low life tramp', 'well do you know why probably because they were concerned that your daughter was laying there dying thats why', 'why would we want to shoot you to death if they wanna shot they can go down the range and shoot they dont have to shoot at you', 'all right our main concern is your daughter thats lying there and possibly dying as youre talking on the telephone', 'why dont you let us take her out now youre gonna keep this up until she dies is that what youre gonna do huh is that the kind of father you are', 'everytime she calls her mother a cunt she tells her mother to fuck herself and me too come on give me

he doesnt have a big brother to help him with his life', 'yeah there is no relationship like a brother and brother you know that you may want to kick his arse sometimes but you know what hes your little brother i bet you take care of him and you know what he probably he looks up a lot to you you need to help your little brother and turn him into a real man and im not going to do anything silly he is probably the most important person you should take care of just like yourself he is your little brother and your mom and dad and if things dont work out between you and xxxxx hey like i said theres lots of women out there and you can find somebody i know its hard but it sounds like youve got your sweetheart since high school and believe me my heart was broken by my sweetheart at high

brother takes his younger brother out', 'okay whos going to take care of the dog if you are not there', 'so thats worth killing yourself over', 'what are your mom and dad going to say when they find out you killed yourself', 'yes i would imagine and then who is your little brother going to have to look up to', 'well dont you think it would be better if he looked up to you as an older brother',

help too you know your dad did 20 years in the core and now he is still working hes going to retire soon and he is going to need your help and i can assure youve got a lot to live for and if you kill yourself youre just going to upset a lot of other people and thats not going to do any good grant why dont you to put that gun down and come outside', 'definitely they are not going to come in thats why we are asking you to come out dont you believe if we were going to come in we would have come in a long time ago', 'okay all right hey everybody has a little bit of an anger problem and how to

walk out there if i go out with my hands clearly in the air naked i think that there is a dozen guns pointing at me the dozen would scream at me to get down on the ground theres dozen with their dogs barking and then even when they trust me i still think theyre going to take me to vista', 'okay ill tell you whats going to happen everything going to vista you know that you know how the rules are we
