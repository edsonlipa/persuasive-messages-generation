Waco_12B_2,176,0,HENRY,How are you doing
Waco_12B_2,177,0,DAVID,Im getting this thing ready here Weve been having some difficulty with the main board We got a Toshiba and TAS [phonetic_sp] cam a studio series 2416 and its its kind of like its been kind of a wild wiring process here
Waco_12B_2,178,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,179,0,DAVID,Because you know we dont put this equipment where were at right now
Waco_12B_2,180,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_2,181,0,DAVID,But anyway yeah we got we got a tape going and stuff And its Im fixing to start up here
Waco_12B_2,182,0,HENRY,Okay good I wanted to bring you up to date And what weve done is weve contacted KRLD
Waco_12B_2,183,0,DAVID,Right Ive been kind of halfway listening to it turned way down but
Waco_12B_2,184,0,HENRY,Okay And as soon as we get the tape were going to have KRLD play it okay In addition to them the National Christian Broadcasting Network is going to play it Now the the thing that I want to tell you about that is theyre going to play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock you know more than once several times But you know thats Phoenix time So were talking about 11 oclock there you know before we before we get it here But were going to give it to KRLD as soon as we get it And thats going to go over you know their network and Im sure other people are going to start picking it up
Waco_12B_2,185,0,DAVID,Okay Let me let me see now So when when its going to first be played at KRLD
Waco_12B_2,186,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_2,187,0,DAVID,So thats local But its going to be at what time at night
Waco_12B_2,188,0,HENRY,No I mean if you want it played more than once well you know Once they play it once theyre going to everybodys going to be picking it up and its going its going to be played you know time and time again
Waco_12B_2,189,0,DAVID,Okay But but the question is is that okay KRLDs going to play it first
Waco_12B_2,190,0,HENRY,Yes
Waco_12B_2,191,0,DAVID,Just because of local curiosity right
Waco_12B_2,192,0,HENRY,Well not because of local curiosity Because you asked it I mean you told me that
Waco_12B_2,193,0,DAVID,Exactly I understand But
Waco_12B_2,194,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_2,195,0,DAVID,but when is what time are they going to play it
Waco_12B_2,196,0,HENRY,As soon as you give it to me
Waco_12B_2,197,0,DAVID,Oh I see Okay But of course its real its real late now
Waco_12B_2,198,0,HENRY,Well no
Waco_12B_2,199,0,DAVID,Okay but thats all right anyway
Waco_12B_2,200,0,HENRY,I mean you know like
Waco_12B_2,201,0,DAVID,Because theyll probably play it more than once
Waco_12B_2,202,0,HENRY,Like like if we get it at at 5 oclock whatever theyll start playing it then
Waco_12B_2,203,0,DAVID,Right
Waco_12B_2,204,0,HENRY,And theyll continue playing it you realize that
Waco_12B_2,205,0,DAVID,Okay
Waco_12B_2,206,0,HENRY,Okay and then
Waco_12B_2,207,0,DAVID,But when is when is the national going to play it
Waco_12B_2,208,0,HENRY,Well they told us that they will play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock But thats
Waco_12B_2,209,0,DAVID,In the morning
Waco_12B_2,210,0,HENRY,Huh Yes But thats thats in thats Arizona time which means it will be 11 oclock here when you know when you start
Waco_12B_2,211,0,DAVID,Eleven to
Waco_12B_2,212,0,HENRY,Until until 4
Waco_12B_2,213,0,DAVID,Right Okay Okay
Waco_12B_2,214,0,HENRY,Now how are you feeling
Waco_12B_2,215,0,DAVID,Like I said its you know Im weak but still I feel better I mean you know I mean physically yes But you know spiritually I feel a lot better
Waco_12B_2,216,6,HENRY,Okay Well I have a concern about your health And Ive been talking to some of our medical people Okay And I dont have any I dont have a real good idea and Im sure you dont right now Because you know because youre like you told me youve got like a sponge or a thing you know and then the pillow or whatever But you know I dont know how much blood youve lost and you you know Of course you told me that when you cough
Waco_12B_2,217,0,DAVID,People people were saying that they were saying that they didnt think because I was talking so strong and all of that for a while that that Id actually been shot But then tonight on the news one of the SWAT team officers said that he was the one that shot me He he shot me twice So that confirms it
Waco_12B_2,218,0,HENRY,Well
Waco_12B_2,219,0,DAVID,I mean I
Waco_12B_2,220,0,HENRY,The
Waco_12B_2,221,0,DAVID,I was just I was just looking out the you know
Waco_12B_2,222,0,HENRY,The the concern that I have
Waco_12B_2,223,0,DAVID,the way there but
Waco_12B_2,224,6,HENRY,Yeah The concern that I have is I dont know you know I dont know how much permanent damage is you know the the wound is causing And the fact that youre not getting medical attention
Waco_12B_2,225,0,DAVID,Well look Whats the foundation of religion Whats man afraid of above anything in the world Whats man afraid of by nature
Waco_12B_2,226,0,HENRY,Death
Waco_12B_2,227,0,DAVID,Death Exactly Okay So the scripture says in Hebrews that Christ died and rose from the grave so that he would have power over him that had power over dead which was the devil and redeem them who through their lives were afraid of death and therefore subject to bondage See some people in religion I mean like the Jews back in those days they were so afraid of dying and being punished of God that they didnt really see the real meaning of the law The law was a revelation of a divine nature And they didnt understand the prophets how the law was to be properly interpreted They didnt really look to the animal sacrifices for what it really meant You know killing a lamb is really a dramatic thing
Waco_12B_2,228,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,229,0,DAVID,You know its sad something innocent has to die
Waco_12B_2,230,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,231,0,DAVID,Because you did something wrong But the but the main key goes way back to Cain and Abel You know Cain didnt want to kill the lamb did he No he wanted to bring his own fruits right
Waco_12B_2,232,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_2,233,0,DAVID,But when God blessed Abel and didnt bless Cain Cain could kill his brother couldnt he
Waco_12B_2,234,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,235,0,DAVID,So you see this story repeats itself So those who do what God wishes you see according to Gods word theyre like Abels And those who do not do Gods wishes well then theyre like Cains
Waco_12B_2,236,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,237,0,DAVID,So now the question right now between us and you guys was which one was the Cain and which one was the Abel
Waco_12B_2,238,0,HENRY,Well
Waco_12B_2,239,0,DAVID,You know Or maybe we were both one and the same
Waco_12B_2,240,0,HENRY,Um hum Well
Waco_12B_2,241,0,DAVID,But
Waco_12B_2,242,6,HENRY,The one concern that I have is you know youve put a lot of time and a lot of effort into your cause okay And we feel that its important to you and to the to your followers to get this message out Okay And I dont want I have a concern that that you may be getting weaker or whatever and you havent finished your tape I want you to concentrate on working on that tape But
Waco_12B_2,243,0,DAVID,I will
Waco_12B_2,244,0,HENRY,let me ask you this And when I was talking to one of the ladies there earlier she indicated that theres some nurses in there that may be you know kind of looking out after you
Waco_12B_2,245,0,DAVID,Well theyve been like changing these weve been using like sheets
Waco_12B_2,246,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_2,247,0,DAVID,Off a bed and wrapping it around tied it up and then it gets wet So then we if I lay still for a while and if I dont laugh I mean this is not funny like Id be laughing but
Waco_12B_2,248,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,249,0,DAVID,You know sometimes you laugh for nothing better else to do But if I dont laugh and if I dont cough then it stops bleeding
Waco_12B_2,250,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_2,251,0,DAVID,But if I move a certain way or laugh or especially cough then boy it starts coming out again
Waco_12B_2,252,6,HENRY,Okay Well were concerned about an infection and were concerned about you going into shock You know now I want you to go ahead and finish your tape
Waco_12B_2,253,0,DAVID,Im working on it
Waco_12B_2,254,0,HENRY,Additionally you know does anybody in there have a a blood pressure cup that they can take your blood pressure
Waco_12B_2,255,0,DAVID,Oh yeah
Waco_12B_2,256,0,HENRY,You you have one
Waco_12B_2,257,0,DAVID,Oh yeah Weve got weve got
