Waco_14,876,0,RADIO_[CHARLIE]_,Weve got a minute and 15 seconds by the our studio clock here And well go by that So if you can stand by well give you a countdown as we get closer to it Again Rick I want to thank you I know its been an incredibly stressful time for you there And not knowing what was around the corner and having to face up to it in an incredibly professional manner And I thank you for all your service And and you can have a couple of days off when we get out of this so you can catch up on your sleep Because I plan to do the same Can we ask one more question
