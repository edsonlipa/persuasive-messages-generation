Waco_13_3,124,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_13_3,125,0,DAVID,This is a small speaker Can you hear that [Playing_following_from_tape] last living disciples on the Isle of Patmos being a prisoner for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ which no doubt are the things Jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the Pharisees and Sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure He being on this Isle of Patmos a prisoner on a Lords day had a vision And it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it He has a messenger the angel of the Lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit And he is told to write the seven churches of Asia which we do see clearly in the scriptures
Waco_13_3,126,0,HENRY,David
Waco_13_3,127,0,DAVID,Yeah
Waco_13_3,128,0,HENRY,That sounds pretty good
Waco_13_3,129,0,DAVID,Like I say its the the way you know if youll hear between it kind of breaths and pushes
Waco_13_3,130,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_13_3,131,0,DAVID,And I tried to make that you know like I say I tried to make it as clear as possible
Waco_13_3,132,0,HENRY,Okay
