Waco_15_2,161,0,JIM,Hey just hang on
Waco_15_2,162,0,STEVE,I will I am
Waco_15_2,163,0,TAPE,Hosea seems to say the word is that youre not high people there should be said Youre the sons of the living God So [indiscernible] says in the gospel if he calls him God [indiscernible] the laws not be broken Well learning Gods word and Gods spirit this is what makes us become born again Born by the spirit acknowledging God Well so so a girl believes in God So does everybody else that believes in God So therefore God the Father has many children doesnt he Christ being the firstborn and thereon everything all thereafter did believe But instead of my father should be my children And thou mayest make princes in all the earth To the person that doesnt really understand scripture this would seem to be a very controversial subject I mean Christ never had any wife Has to be spiritual I will make thy name remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever Well even if it is spiritual we know one thing We the servants of God know that Psalm 45 is the very prophecy which must be hereafter according to the first seal But just to make sure we know its going to be fulfilled lets turn in our Bibles to Revelation 19 just so we can get a better caption of what we are really looking at Now remember in the 18th chapter of Revelation we know that Babylon the great fall She made all nations drink of some kind of wine of the wrath of her fornication Now we find that something very bad happened And at verse 23 of chapter 18 no more light of a candle shall shine there nor the voice of the bridegroom or the voice of the bride Well the merchants were the great men of the earth it says in verse 23 And for their by thy sorceries were all nations deceived We all know about capitalization We know about advertisement selling something making it better than what it really is And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth You see just because people dont accept the truth in Gods word does not mean its not true Theres some truth that we might teach could get us in trouble But anyway the first chapter 19 it says and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in the heaven saying alleluia Salvation and glory and honor and power to the Lord our God Why For true and righteous are his judgments I wonder [indiscernible] [Tape_continues_playing]
Waco_15_2,164,0,JIM,Steve
