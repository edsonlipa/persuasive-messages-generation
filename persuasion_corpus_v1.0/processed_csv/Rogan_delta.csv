Rogan_delta,280,1,PN60,uh force you Were just trying to make this thing as easy on everybody as possible but we do feel that <CH32_First_Name> with her little girl out in Denver you heard her husband was killed in an accident That little child has just one parent and we want to get that girl out of there
Rogan_delta,281,4,HT01,I understand all that and uh [pause] I feel that [pause] well we talked about this earlier Uh theres no use changing uh changing the story now
Rogan_delta,282,1,PN60,Come on now we got to change a little bit every day We have to change and and cooperate and show our cooperation Uh before when we talked we didnt know <CH32_First_Name> s husband was deceased We didnt know the little girl only had one parent that she is depending upon and uh the little girl needs her mother and certainly uh we want to help the little girl We want to help you We want to help everybody but right now we feel that thats the prime thing on the whole the whole thing is whether youre gonna cooperate with us in that one little request
Rogan_delta,283,0,HT01,Well sir I agree and thats more reason why you should uh speed up your processing
Rogan_delta,284,7,PN60,Well thats thats probably true that we should speed it up but uh government red tape being such as it is we have to go at a Certain pace We cant just flick a switch from on to off It has to go at a certain pace You know that and I know that and uh we are concerned about uh <CH32_First_Name> s little girl primarily Were not I think <CH32_First_Name> s safe but the poor little child uh needs to talk with her mother and needs to be
Rogan_delta,285,6,HT01,Kansas City and right now Im in a position where to you Im just going to wait and if youre not going to cooperate with me then I things are going to come down to a deadline

Rogan_delta,292,0,HT01,Well I have probably just as much concern for that young girl as you do and possibly more and that is more of a reason why you should speed things up
Rogan_delta,293,7,PN60,Im not in a position to speed things up I would if I could but uh I cant move Washington You know Youve been in the army You know the bureaucratic ways that the bureaus up there go through and we have to live with that now Uh I cant control that but you can control the situation that were talking about

Rogan_delta,539,0,ON82,<HT01_First_Name> this is <HT01s_Lawyers_Middle_Name> Come back
Rogan_delta,540,0,HTO1,Hello
Rogan_delta,541,1,ON82,<Prisoners_Middle_Name> s a little nervous as you can tell but what hes telling you is straight Theres really nothing we can do on the airport Weve got to do it in court Im gonna be with you Ill come out to the plane Ive got their solemn promise and I theres an agent here that Ive known personally for 15 years wouldnt lie to me not gonna be any funny business Theyll let me come on the plane with you after you release the people and Ill have one agent with me in the car and Ive got Judge <Judge_Last_Name> standing by Hes the judge that lowered your bond and theyre gonna take us directly to the courthouse before Judge <Judge_Last_Name> and Im convinced and I wouldnt tell you this if I wasnt Theyve done everything Ive asked them to do so far Im convinced theres not gonna be anything but lets go in and lets fight our court battle We cant fight it at the airport but we can fight it in court Youve made your point <Prisoners_Middle_Name> very much appreciates it Nows the time to to put this aside and go on in see Judge <Judge_Last_Name> do the best we can do try to get <Prisoners_Middle_Name> out on bond for at least awhile anyway before while theyre doing the police investigation and do what we have to do How do you feel about that
Rogan_delta,542,0,ON83,<HT01s_First_Name> uh theres one bad thing about this situation uh based on my conversation with <HT01s_Lawyers_Last_Name> and <Other_Lawyer> You havent uh count your demands in any political etiology or anything The only place we could go would be out of this country fly to say Cuba and I dont think counselor would let us in there Uh see the thing is is those countries would be embarassed by Uh well it it just based on my viewpoint you know to whatever it means it doesnt look good If it did I would come down there with you and [radio_cut_out]
Rogan_delta,543,1,ON82,<HT01_First_Name> this is <HT01s_Lawyers_Middle_Name> What do you think Were not hurrying you for the decision but <Prisoners_Middle_Name> and I think that we can help you that youre going down the a deadend alley now and its not worth it so let me try to help you and you youve already helped <Prisoners_Middle_Name> all you can Let me try to help you now
