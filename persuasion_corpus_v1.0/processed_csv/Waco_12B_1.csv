Waco_12B_1,4,0,DAVID,Dont touch it Dont touch it because its you know someone was touching the cord and its jittery
Waco_12B_1,5,0,HENRY,Oh okay
Waco_12B_1,6,0,DAVID,So that what I do is I I always teach with questions
Waco_12B_1,7,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,8,0,DAVID,So I I teach my students I say now look I cant save you you know I am not anything as far as you can see any different from what you can see you know
Waco_12B_1,9,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,10,0,DAVID,We are not to worship men So Ill tell them look this is a Ill make them read the revelation of who who gave it to him what reason Then when I take them throughout the revelation their eyes are seeing the book Their mind is developing pictures so that when we get into the part of the seals they see very clearly the scripture teaches that none but the lamb can reveal these things And I go now wait Right here the lamb reveals it He reveals the first seal is a man on a white horse
Waco_12B_1,11,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,12,0,DAVID,Now you know whats so hard about understanding that Apparently it seems like hes going to war Seems like Christ is not only a savior hes a destroyer Conquering and conquering Except we cant speculate can we Of course they agree with me I says now we shouldnt add our opinions Because we really dont know the details of this I says look here at the second seal They are given a great sword that they should kill one another I said now why how does that reveal Jesus You know Christ doesnt teach to kill one another You know he teaches love and turn the cheek doesnt he
Waco_12B_1,13,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,14,0,DAVID,So we cant speculate here
Waco_12B_1,15,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,16,0,DAVID,So then when we get to chapter 10 after we begin to read throughout the seven seals the trumpets start in the seventh seal My students are brought to the attention of very strange and weird symbols or omens which again speculation is not the facts
Waco_12B_1,17,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,18,0,DAVID,Now we get to chapter 10 we see that sometime during the sixth trumpet John records and I saw another mighty angel sent from heaven clothed with a cloud and as faded as it were the sun You know and his feet as pillars of fire Stood up on the earth and sea had his little handbook opened And he cries and a lion roareth When he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices Now again we dont know what this is all about All we know is that the only thunders we know about is in Gods throne the lightning thunders and voices We know when the lamb opens the first seal there is the first thunder But it says John is told to seal those things and write them not But John was told that the mighty angel swore by the God that created all things when theres time no longer this mystery of God will be finished So see my students begin to think about those things What is this mystery of the the little book thats opened Whats this mystery of the the revelation of Jesus Christ And of course the last chapter when we learn about the river of the water of life we know that Christ is the Lord God of the holy prophets You know Christ is the one who from the beginning of time spake into the prophets because he is the word of God
Waco_12B_1,19,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,20,0,DAVID,Made angel or hes the word of God made flesh It depends on what the will of the Father really is But the keynote is he promised he says I sent my angel And he says I come upwards with me So then at that point my students begin to realize that the coming of Christ has something to do with a message a message that only he can reveal
Waco_12B_1,21,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,22,0,DAVID,So then I ask them well would you like to learn the seven seals Now of course they look at me real funny then dont they
Waco_12B_1,23,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,24,0,DAVID,Yeah see once we get that established about the judgment that only the lamb can reveal these things And when I ask them would you like me to show you the seals I wont tell you but Ill show you then they look at me real funny like well hey you cant show me these things And I go well thats right I cant But Christ can right Well yeah I says well let me show you something here in chapter three of Revelation It says these saith he that is holy He hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth I go what is that key Of course they dont know And I go let me show you I tell them theres 150 Psalms that David of Ove [phonetic_sp] wrote the Psalms you know
Waco_12B_1,25,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,26,0,DAVID,And Christ is the root and offspring of David isnt he
Waco_12B_1,27,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,28,0,DAVID,God promised David to Christ that one day God would sit on the throne of David in the flesh of Christ right
Waco_12B_1,29,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,30,0,DAVID,And that was fulfilled in Christ
Waco_12B_1,31,0,HENRY,Yeah
Waco_12B_1,32,0,DAVID,So then I began to take them to the 45th Psalm and I go now lets open this Psalm up and lets look at what Gods thinking about When you come up here to my church youll see the Father sitting on the throne And the reason why he wants to know who can reveal his thoughts is because he put his thoughts down in a book He does this so that we can receive mercy and grace instead of wraths or unrighteousness which is not too righteous So then the 45th Psalm begins to talk in behalf of God Now I always emphasize at my students stop looking at me Theyve got to look at God They got to be in the spirit
Waco_12B_1,33,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,34,0,DAVID,So then when this 45th Psalm starts saying my heart is inditing a good matter you know were looking at the rock right Were looking at God whose got the book right
Waco_12B_1,35,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,36,0,DAVID,And we already know the first seal pertains to a man on a white horse right
Waco_12B_1,37,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,38,0,DAVID,So whose heart Is it Davids heart or is it Gods heart Well the scripture says David was a man after Gods own heart Not in the same magnitude but nonetheless the same spirit of the future Where the Son of God was to be made manifest God says his hearts inditing a good matter he wants to talk about the things he has made Hes a creator isnt he
Waco_12B_1,39,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,40,0,DAVID,Touching his king
Waco_12B_1,41,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,42,0,DAVID,And his tongue is the pen of a ready writer So its written in the book isnt it
Waco_12B_1,43,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,44,0,DAVID,So that we find in Psalms 45 that he does write prosperously He does have a bow He does have a crown because of truth Now that doesnt mean that when Christ comes hes going to come on a white horse with a bow and shoot people in the heart in their heart with an arrow But it does mean that theres a truth that must be made known Because the real thing to emphasize in that 45th Psalm is when it says upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir Now the question is who is that queen Is she a literal girl or is she a church Nonetheless whether shes literal or spiritual nonetheless love is literal Whether we love Christ spiritually or whether we love him literally theyre one in the same Okay now it says hearken O daughter and consider Now whether were a girl or not all of us who have eyes to see should consider in the 45th Psalm who God has revealed so that in Revelation 19 when the marriage lamb comes its very clear in that chapter who that man on the white horse is And it says that he has a name Of course in 19 it says behold I saw a white horse and he that sat upon him had a crown many crowns on his head He takes those crowns off the leeches of the earth youll find in other prophecies It says he has a vesture dipped in blood and his name is The Word of God Okay
Waco_12B_1,45,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,46,0,DAVID,So the keynote is that we begin to learn that what the revelation is is its a well look You know you know in a movie when they want to advertise a movie
Waco_12B_1,47,0,HENRY,Uh huh
Waco_12B_1,48,0,DAVID,They dont they dont sit there and give you 15 20 minutes of the movie do they with advertisement What do they give you A preview right
Waco_12B_1,49,0,HENRY,Exactly
Waco_12B_1,50,0,DAVID,Okay So If the mystery of God the seven thunders are the seven seals if it is to be finished as God declared to the prophets then found in the prophecies are the seven seals
Waco_12B_1,51,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,52,0,DAVID,And youll find that in the first seal the truth there is about Christ destroying his enemies
Waco_12B_1,53,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,54,0,DAVID,And the only enemies he destroys are those who are against his truth
Waco_12B_1,55,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,56,0,DAVID,And thats regarding the marriage which unitifies [sic] humanity and divinity into one mind Only Gods thoughts are worth anything you see Mans thoughts are vanity
Waco_12B_1,57,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,58,0,DAVID,But Gods thoughts are eternal
Waco_12B_1,59,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,60,0,DAVID,So through truth we learn why Christ says in the Gospel of John when he says my hes having a fight with the Sanhedrin remember
Waco_12B_1,61,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,62,0,DAVID,And the Pharisee says my doctrine is not mine Its that which I received from my Father
Waco_12B_1,63,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,64,0,DAVID,So hes trying to tell him its Gods book he says now if you continue in my doctrine youre my disciples indeed And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
Waco_12B_1,65,0,HENRY,Uh huh
Waco_12B_1,66,0,DAVID,Now you know no ones free today right Were all in bondage [indiscernible] arent we
Waco_12B_1,67,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,68,0,DAVID,So we have to learn these seals
Waco_12B_1,69,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,70,0,DAVID,Of course we dont just learn the seals We do the seals
Waco_12B_1,71,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,72,0,DAVID,As we learn the seals we do the seals
Waco_12B_1,73,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,74,0,DAVID,Obedience Not just hearing but obedience
Waco_12B_1,75,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,76,0,DAVID,So anyway if you ever get a chance to read the 45th Psalm look at it judge it for yourself
Waco_12B_1,77,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,78,0,DAVID,And look at the first seal and see if those things kind of look exactly alike
Waco_12B_1,79,5,HENRY,Okay Okay Now does is Steve aware Im sure he must be of your teachings And therefore we must assume that based on your leadership and your teachings that should you get so sick you know that you cant continue that he will be ready to assume the responsibility for the rest of the people that are contained within the
Waco_12B_1,80,0,DAVID,Well what Im going to do is Im going to tell everybody
Waco_12B_1,81,0,HENRY,Uh huh
Waco_12B_1,82,0,DAVID,what my negotiations with you are
Waco_12B_1,83,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,84,0,DAVID,And in so doing everybody will know that when we have done and completed our work then weve done our work and everything and theres no reason to die Because like I say the truth is to give life Its not to give death
Waco_12B_1,85,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_1,86,0,DAVID,And the whole key is this you know Christians in general believe that if they shall serve God they shall be persecuted
Waco_12B_1,87,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,88,0,DAVID,But in our generation even though sin does abound great is a lot let me say this much Though sin abounds greatly more so than ever before
Waco_12B_1,89,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,90,0,DAVID,The point still is as graced as much more abound
Waco_12B_1,91,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,92,0,DAVID,Remember the seals are not revealed to condemn us or destroy us Theyre theyre revealed so that all those who profess Christ can come together into one body
Waco_12B_1,93,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,94,0,DAVID,Thats what brings the fall of confusion Theres too many organizations professing to believe in one God
Waco_12B_1,96,0,HENRY,Yeah
Waco_12B_1,97,0,DAVID,Oh it scares me
Waco_12B_1,98,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,99,0,DAVID,Professing to believe in one God and yet theres only one doctrine remaining for us to know to bring us all into unity
Waco_12B_1,100,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,101,0,DAVID,Of the faith You know we cant have faith and and presumption
Waco_12B_1,103,0,DAVID,Hello
Waco_12B_1,104,0,HENRY,Yeah
Waco_12B_1,105,0,DAVID,Whats causing that
Waco_12B_1,106,0,HENRY,I dont know It must be your cord Somebody must be stepping on it or pulling at it or something
Waco_12B_1,107,0,DAVID,Right Okie doke Okay let me
Waco_12B_1,108,0,HENRY,Now you because of because of the way that you have revealed the seals and and your understanding of the Biblical readings I have to assume that everybody thats contained within there
Waco_12B_1,109,0,DAVID,Theres two plans God always gives two ways out
Waco_12B_1,110,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,111,0,DAVID,You see God see if you had a better if you had a better understanding of the prophecies For instance in Isaiah where it says behold for the mountains of fear that brings good tidings
Waco_12B_1,112,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,113,0,DAVID,Its a sad story of Isaiah 52 and 53
Waco_12B_1,114,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,115,0,DAVID,Okay But whereas in Nahum behold will the mountains it tells you a different story
Waco_12B_1,116,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,117,0,DAVID,Not that the two prophecies do not harmonize But God has a plan like in Ezekiel where God says that if I shall pronounce a blessing against a people you know because theyve kept my laws you know then if they shall break my laws that the blessing that I pronounced against them I will take away And if I also curse a nation than it shall be no more that I shall destroy If it turned from its wicked ways then will I also turn from my evil which I have proposed to do and will bless them So Ezekiel tells us in 33rd chapter that you know God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked
Waco_12B_1,118,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,119,0,DAVID,No pleasure
Waco_12B_1,120,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,121,0,DAVID,So the thing of it is that like Paul says in Hebrews 6 he says that that therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ he says the doctrine of baptism and resurrection You know hes talking about the simple things You know the very first steps in Christianity He says lets go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of these simple doctrines You know the basic things like Jesus loves me and he died for me and I must be baptized You know we we do that once right
Waco_12B_1,122,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,123,0,DAVID,He says for its impossible for those who were once enlightened if they shall fall away In other words dont progress with truth you know Peter says be established in the present truth which means if theres a present truth there must be a past truth If if theres like we might believe the message of Noah now right
Waco_12B_1,124,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,125,0,DAVID,But in the days of Noah no one believed it
Waco_12B_1,126,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,127,0,DAVID,They perished because of unbelief
Waco_12B_1,128,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_1,129,0,DAVID,Now we may believe the message of Moses but the message of Moses is over Those in his day didnt believe it
Waco_12B_1,130,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,131,0,DAVID,But you see now we may believe the message of Christ 2 000 years ago
Waco_12B_1,132,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,133,0,DAVID,But of course when it was being given nobody believed it
Waco_12B_1,134,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_1,135,0,DAVID,You see thats the whole thing Now today weve got one final revelation Of course you know everyone believes in Jesus today
Waco_12B_1,136,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,137,0,DAVID,Just like everyone believed in Moses in Christs day
Waco_12B_1,138,0,HENRY,Yeah
Waco_12B_1,139,0,DAVID,But maybe they dont know that Christ like they should
Waco_12B_1,140,0,HENRY,Youre right
Waco_12B_1,141,0,DAVID,So you offer them the seven seals you know And well like 2 000 years ago you know the Sanhedrin says to Christ we be not the sons born of fornication Sure its easy today to accept Christ as a virgin birth right
Waco_12B_1,142,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,143,0,DAVID,But back then the general public view was that he was born Mary had had fornication with somebody
Waco_12B_1,144,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,145,0,DAVID,You know so you know they always see Christ as lovely and meek but when you when you read whats going on Oh When you read the gospels he could throw over some tables at the church couldnt he
Waco_12B_1,146,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,147,0,DAVID,He was considered radical by a lot of people
Waco_12B_1,148,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_12B_1,149,0,DAVID,But certain people just pick up highlights of his nature and dont look at the other side
Waco_12B_1,150,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,151,0,DAVID,So when he warns us in the Book of Revelation he gives specific counsels to the churches of Asia hey the Lord dont mess around he tells church of Ephesus Returning to the first verse there Ill take your candle away
Waco_12B_1,152,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,153,0,DAVID,Now if you walk in darkness youre going to end up in hell You know Smyrna Thyatira Sardis they ought to see He tells them that theyre lukewarm hot or cold He says Ill spew you out of my mouth Who and is that the same Christ we learn about on the cross Hey you just you just let a man crucify you once
Waco_12B_1,154,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,155,0,DAVID,And then the thing of it is the guy says Im sorry Okay Can forgive him But then he needs to open his eyes and he needs to learn a little obedience doesnt he
Waco_12B_1,156,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,157,0,DAVID,Okay But the thing of it is if he turns away from you the second time isnt he crucifying you afresh
Waco_12B_1,158,0,HENRY,Really
Waco_12B_1,159,0,DAVID,You would think Okay So now by the world turned away from these seven seals just because Im ugly or they may think Im crazy You know I didnt think were supposed to judge anybody according to flesh
Waco_12B_1,160,0,HENRY,Really Well I think that that youre going to reveal the way to you know to safety for for your people You know and were going to of course afford you the opportunity to make that tape Do you think youre going to be working on that very soon
Waco_12B_1,161,0,DAVID,Yeah Im fixing to get on it right now
Waco_12B_1,162,0,HENRY,Okay Well I just want you
Waco_12B_1,163,0,DAVID,This is what Ive been wanting for the longest time
Waco_12B_1,164,5,HENRY,Okay Well I want you to know you know that that Im your friend That the people out here consider you a friend And although we dont understand the seals
Waco_12B_1,165,0,DAVID,I realize that
Waco_12B_1,166,5,HENRY,as you do you know and we may be going down a different path of servitude than you are you know we still have the same basic goals
Waco_12B_1,167,0,DAVID,As you know Christ youre supposed to walk in him Thats what the new covenant teaches us But at the same time youre not supposed to reject any additional light that comes
Waco_12B_1,168,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,169,0,DAVID,Youre supposed to grow into the full stature of the body of Christ
Waco_12B_1,170,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,171,0,DAVID,And your faith virtue virtue and the knowledge in all his temperance You know like I say were supposed to grow as Colossians says
Waco_12B_1,172,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,173,0,DAVID,Receiving the knowledge in Him when it comes All the New Testament writers if you really read those writings again Romans all the way through youll find all of them are talking about one day Christ is going to come and reveal seals Thats what theyre all talking about about that knowledge of of that God had bodily you know
Waco_12B_1,174,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,175,0,DAVID,Talking about the knowledge of the of the spirit thats within Christ
Waco_12B_1,176,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,177,0,DAVID,So seven seals
Waco_12B_1,178,0,HENRY,Okay I want you
Waco_12B_1,179,0,DAVID,Because Christ is one body All the prophets and apostles are hid in one body
Waco_12B_1,180,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,181,0,DAVID,One bread and one wine
Waco_12B_1,182,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,183,0,DAVID,One truth So you gentiles are were supposed to have an opportunity too in the latter days And were here there now And you know why would why would Christ come back as a holy and and perfect person when you all dont even believe in the law anymore
Waco_12B_1,184,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,185,0,DAVID,Even though the law was nailed to the cross wasnt it
Waco_12B_1,186,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,187,0,DAVID,But you know because the law is nailed to the cross now you take a look at the law And he and he says Father forgive them So how much more you who stands down at the foot of the cross are to forgive your neighbor
Waco_12B_1,188,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,189,0,DAVID,One sinner to another sinner you know should forgive one another
Waco_12B_1,190,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,191,0,DAVID,But even more so we should realize that that good spirit went into the hand of God and the word theres three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one
Waco_12B_1,192,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,193,0,DAVID,And thats where we have to really pay attention if we want to win the reward of righteousness
Waco_12B_1,194,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,195,0,DAVID,To realize it in every generation They would not hear the prophets because like Hosea he had to marry two prostitute wives didnt he
Waco_12B_1,196,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,197,0,DAVID,Okay Isaiah walked naked and barefoot So did Micah
Waco_12B_1,198,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,199,0,DAVID,I mean God does obstacles like you would never think someone like someone like Samson could be a judge of Israel could you
Waco_12B_1,200,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_12B_1,201,0,DAVID,I mean but you know he went around and messed around with Philistine women didnt he
Waco_12B_1,202,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,203,0,DAVID,And the Father says is there never a daughter amongst my own brethren And he says no get this Philistine girl for me because she pleased me well The scripture says for they knew not that it was of the Lord For Lord had an occasion against the Philistines You know just so much stuff in the scripture people overlook about the mysterious ways So back at Christ in his day he says regard ye amongst the heathen and wonder marvelously For I will work a work in your days that you will not believe though it be told you And then he talks about destroying the nations by discovering the foundation unto the neck Well if you didnt know Daniel 2s prophecy about the image we talked about earlier
Waco_12B_1,204,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,205,0,DAVID,You would never know what it meant in regards to discovering the foundation What is the foundation Well the foundation of the Kingdom of God is in truth And the truth is in the days of these kings Daniel says Gods tolerance of the gentile nations ruling over his people is over Gods going to gather back the hundred and four thousand Gods going to choose the Jews Because the gentiles are going to do worse to a Messiah who comes who comes to teach the truth than what the Jews did 2 000 years ago And I would do anything to avoid that to keep that from happening
Waco_12B_1,206,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,207,0,DAVID,Okay
Waco_12B_1,208,0,HENRY,But but help me
Waco_12B_1,209,0,DAVID,So let me get this tape
Waco_12B_1,210,0,HENRY,help me understand what your role is You are with respect to revealing the seals Is it the lamb
Waco_12B_1,211,0,DAVID,Well remember the lamb well look in Psalms 4 that will tell you who I am
Waco_12B_1,212,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,213,0,DAVID,See Psalms 1 Psalms 2 remember the anointed one the heathen rage
Waco_12B_1,214,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,215,0,DAVID,And they say lets break their bands asunder
Waco_12B_1,216,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,217,0,DAVID,What ties the Son to the Father The word
Waco_12B_1,218,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,219,0,DAVID,And what portion of Gods word has been sealed Seven truths of the Bible right
Waco_12B_1,220,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,221,0,DAVID,Okay Now the challenge is for anybody in the world my friend
Waco_12B_1,222,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,223,0,DAVID,Anybody So in Psalms 3 the Psalm goes on to say Lord how are they increased to trouble me For they be many that rise up against me There be many say of my soul Theres no help for him in God But it also says Ill be not afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves together against me round about In Psalms 4 it says help Lord It says hear me when I call O God of my righteousness Then it says O you sons of men how long will you love vanity How long will you turn my glory into shame How long will you seek after leasing He tells them he says but you should know that God has separated him apart that is godly for Himself The Lord will hear when I call unto him Yes stand in awe and sin not Serve the Lord with fear Rejoice with trembling You see
Waco_12B_1,224,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,225,0,DAVID,Meditate upon your own bed
Waco_12B_1,226,0,HENRY,Okay
Waco_12B_1,227,0,DAVID,Now see the thing of it that Psalm all the Psalms are a dialogue of Christ You see the sons of men turn his glory to shame because they dont know where hes coming from
Waco_12B_1,228,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_12B_1,229,0,DAVID,You know who has God separated apart thats godly for Himself Who Christ
