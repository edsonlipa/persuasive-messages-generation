Waco_10A_3,72,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,73,0,MR_KORESH,Just a little pain
Waco_10A_3,74,1,HENRY,Okay What wed like to do David is wed like to continue working as we were before Wed like to continue bringing out additional children as best as we can with the same agreement that we had before And wed like to work if possible you know everybody has a concern here about you We feel that you know that youre not really taking care of yourself We dont want anything to happen to you Wed like for you to consider coming out yourself We want everybody to come out we want everybody to come out of this alive We dont want you to give up and we feel that you are Thats a great concern to to all of us
Waco_10A_3,75,0,MR_KORESH,Well like I was telling Jim you know I told Jim to to look into that Bible I told him to look into Revelation 4 and 5 I told him to look into those seals Now if you look at the the fifth seal if you look at the sixth seal if you look into Isaiah 13 if you look in Joel 2 if you look into the back of Nahum whats fixing to happen has already been foretold I teach seven seals Now whatever that means you know Id like to talk with you guys in full Id like you to grab a Bible sit down and follow me word by word see what the ancients have foresaw And that way wed have a better understanding But I realize that you know most of you are not ready for that Youve got your own way of doing things
Waco_10A_3,76,1,HENRY,Well one of the concerns that we have you know that I feel that you may have is you mentioned earlier that you felt that people were calling you a cult leader okay If you give up that may in fact be the impression that everybody has whereas if you continue to fight in terms of trying to save your life and continue to lead your people thats not the impression that will be created
Waco_10A_3,77,0,MR_KORESH,Look
Waco_10A_3,78,1,HENRY,Youve been a family person okay And your family
Waco_10A_3,79,0,MR_KORESH,Oh Im definitely a family person
Waco_10A_3,80,1,HENRY,And your family needs you And everybody wants to see you come out of this alive
Waco_10A_3,81,0,MR_KORESH,Look Henry
Waco_10A_3,82,1,HENRY,Everybody needs you These people need you the kids need you
Waco_10A_3,83,0,MR_KORESH,Youre not going to listen to me are you
Waco_10A_3,84,0,HENRY,I will listen to you
Waco_10A_3,85,0,MR_KORESH,Okay youre listening now
Waco_10A_3,86,0,HENRY,Yes I am
Waco_10A_3,87,0,MR_KORESH,Okay The event that youre now fixing to witness is youre fixing to see a government a government thats been blessed See there was an ancient empire called Babylon
Waco_10A_3,88,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,89,0,MR_KORESH,Land of the Chaldeans And before Babylon ruled the then known world God had a people that he brought out of Egypt and God had given them laws and statutes and God had stated unto Israel which was a cult because they had one leader Moses and one right hand man Aaron and God says and promised that if they will keep his laws hell make them the head of all nations If they break his laws hell scatter them amongst the nations and the nations of the heathens will rule over them So for many many hundreds of years God forebores his people But finally the days came when Israel became worse than the heathens So God arose prophets such as Isaiah Hosea Obadiah Malachi Zephaniah Habakkuk you know these prophets Nahum And God foretold in these prophets how that theyd be scattered amongst the nations In the Book of Daniel Daniel was shown while under the Chaldean captivity he was shown that the nations of the earth that shall rule over Gods people will be symbolized as one great image and the image will be head of gold arms of silver belly of brass legs of iron feet part of iron and part of clay And Daniel says to the king Nebuchadnezzar the highest ruling position of the land in that day Daniel says thou oh King of this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and yet a third kingdom of brass And then a fourth kingdom dreadful and terrible it shall cometh the whole world
Waco_10A_3,90,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,91,0,MR_KORESH,And then there shall be a kingdom that shall be at the ten toes partly strong and partly broken So when Rome split up under the nomadic kingdoms it fell into many different kingdoms
Waco_10A_3,92,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,93,0,MR_KORESH,We know it as Europe Now Daniel goes on to explain that while Europe is still in existence he goes on to say [indiscernible] behold a stone came and smote the image in the feet and they had gold and silver and brass and iron was all made as the chaff of the summer threshing floors Well this stone is the subject of which the Book of Revelation talks about It talks about that which must be hereafter that God will one day in the future in the end of the world shall come and sit on his throne in heaven and therell be one question asked in heaven The question is who is worthy to open this book The book is in the right hand of God And to lose these seven seals thereof scripture clearly teaches Christendom that no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open and he looked thereon
Waco_10A_3,94,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,95,0,MR_KORESH,But the lamb the lamb is symbolized as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns You know God creates things in seven days doesnt he
Waco_10A_3,96,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,97,0,MR_KORESH,Okay Theres only one many who knows what that book teaches But for the sake of humanity the acid test revolving around the subjects in this book revolve around Christ in heaven opening the seals and what is witnessed is a man on a white horse a man on a red horse black and pale Dead souls under the altar described to God because of their blood thats been shed and then the time when the sun and moon and stars will be darkened the heavens will part as a scroll and the great man mighty men free men bonded men shall cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb but the great Davids wrath has come
Waco_10A_3,98,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,99,0,MR_KORESH,So these subjects are mysteries cause nobody really has a real thorough opinion to really know the real meanings of these things But in Chapter 10 after the student of scripture is read and become familiar with the symbols in Chapter 10 after talking about an army of 200 million that overthrow the world it talks about a mighty angel coming down from heaven And he has in his hand a little book and its opened and seven thunders are uttered seven thunders And John was told that when theres time no longer this mystery of God this revelation of Jesus Christ the seven seals will be finished as God has declared to his servants the prophets
Waco_10A_3,100,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,101,0,MR_KORESH,So in this 22nd chapter after a person takes the time to read these things its very clear the statement Christ says I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David Now Ancient David was a great king wasnt he
Waco_10A_3,102,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,103,0,MR_KORESH,Hes the one that took his little sling stone and slew the great giant Goliath
Waco_10A_3,104,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_10A_3,105,0,MR_KORESH,Yeah okay So what happened was he says behold I come quickly My reward is with me to give it to every man according as his work shall be
Waco_10A_3,106,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,107,0,MR_KORESH,Now when Christ comes the question is going to be what did the father give him that no other man in heaven was worthy to receive No man was worthy A book right
Waco_10A_3,108,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,109,0,MR_KORESH,God gave him a book a revelation of himself that the father claims hes the author of this book And when the lamb comes hes going to bring this book and mankind is supposed to find out that it is the Bible the Bible which the prophets of God having spoken by the spirit that God gave them having volumed a testament in regards to those events that must be fulfilled in the latter days Now in Revelation 13 John witnesses in regards to the seventh seal John sees a beast This beast has a head like a lion a body like a leopard feet of a bear In Daniel 7 Daniel foretold that the empires of Babylon Persia Greece and Rome would be symbolized Babylon as a lion Persia as a bear Greece as a leopard And the fourth beast he said would devour all the three beasts before it and conquer the world Now that was Rome Daniel also says in the days of this kingdom they will kill the prince of the covenant They could change Gods times and Gods laws and place abomination to make desolate false religion We know the only true religion is the religion of God
Waco_10A_3,110,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,111,0,MR_KORESH,Now Christ died during the times of Rome and on the cross Very clearly its written in the gospel records He said father forgive them for they know not what they do
Waco_10A_3,112,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,113,0,MR_KORESH,And then he said into thy hand I commit my spirit And the hand of God has a book the word By the word of God God made heaven and earth And by his word there was prophets The events that youre now witnessing are taking place Now what is taking place Well in the Book of Micah it says in that day they shall gather together and they shall say let thine be defiled that they know not the thoughts of the Lord neither do they understand his counsel All of the prophets through the Book of Nahum it talks about Messiah it talks about well for instance to make it real simple Christ says he has the key of David in revelation So in the Book of the Psalms for instance Psalms 2 David sees a vision of the future of a confrontation between man and mans law
Waco_10A_3,114,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,115,0,MR_KORESH,and God and Gods law
Waco_10A_3,116,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,117,0,MR_KORESH,Now Revelation 13 tells us that theres a lamb like beast thatll rise up having two horns and itll speak as a dragon Now weve got to identify what great empire arose up after Europe thats a great empire thats lamb like or Christian but yet doesnt really tell the truth Well the only great empire weve known is the United States of America Now back to Psalms 2 the psalm says why do the heathen rage You know the heathen dont know God
Waco_10A_3,118,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,119,0,MR_KORESH,They dont know his word
Waco_10A_3,120,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,121,0,MR_KORESH,And they get angry
Waco_10A_3,122,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,123,0,MR_KORESH,It says and the people imagine vain things for the leaders of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord
Waco_10A_3,124,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,125,0,MR_KORESH,and against his anointed
Waco_10A_3,126,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,127,0,MR_KORESH,Thats Christ you see
Waco_10A_3,128,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,129,0,MR_KORESH,Saying let us break his bands asunder Now what are the seven bands that Christ promises to bring when he comes again The seven seals right
Waco_10A_3,130,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,131,0,MR_KORESH,But Zachariah and the other prophets say that the world will not regard these messages of mercy They have no interest in being instructed by anyone but themselves Now they say let us break his bands asunder let us cast his cords away from us But scripture says which is taking place right now it says that he that sits in the heavens Thats the father you see
Waco_10A_3,132,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,133,0,MR_KORESH,shall laugh for the Lord shall have them the heathen in confusion See the heathen dont know what theyre doing And this time they cant be forgiven because this time they willfully reject the subject which so plainly has been laid in the Book of Revelation a subject which everyone is to be very familiarized with for the latter days And yet theyre to understand by earnest study that these things will remain a mystery until Christ comes again
Waco_10A_3,134,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,135,0,MR_KORESH,To reveal these mysteries
Waco_10A_3,136,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,137,0,MR_KORESH,So the heathen and their tactics in dealing with a person based upon rumors and based upon their laws they fail to understand that God also has a law and God also has a kingdom and God also has a key So what takes place it says then shall the Lord speak unto them in his wrath Thats what happens during the sixth seal
Waco_10A_3,138,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,139,0,MR_KORESH,The sun and moon and stars is darkened the heaven departs as a scroll and the great men of the earth cry to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the reality that they would not know aforetime what God said will be So they end up fulfilling prophecy not knowing what side theyre doing But to the wise when God speaks in his wrath they already know of the events And it says yet have I set my king up on my holy hill of Zion So irrespective of what attitude the heathen may take against the truth of the seven seals or the man that is trying to teach the seven seals irrespective Gods kingdom the stone God himself is going to intervene and hes going to hit the image in the feet and its all going to blow away and Gods going to take the jurisdiction and power from all the great men of the earth and all that the prophets have spoken is to be fulfilled
Waco_10A_3,140,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,141,0,MR_KORESH,Now the psalm continues to say I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee So we know the anointed one is Christ dont we Christ is the Son of God in Psalms 2 right
Waco_10A_3,142,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,143,0,MR_KORESH,And it says the father says to the son ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the earth for thy possession for thou shalt dash the heathen to pieces with a rod of iron and shall break them as a potters vessel Now thats pretty bad isnt it
Waco_10A_3,144,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,145,0,MR_KORESH,I mean nobody wants to be hurt do they
Waco_10A_3,146,0,HENRY,No really
Waco_10A_3,147,0,MR_KORESH,So thats why in Psalms 2 the subject is clear the mission of the lamb the anointed one is to teach the seals okay
Waco_10A_3,148,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,149,0,MR_KORESH,Now the reason why the prophecy is written is because it continues to say now therefore be wise ye rulers of the world be instructed ye judges of the earth Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling Kiss the son least he be angry and ye perish in the way when is wrath is kindled but a little Now Im not mad at you guys you know
Waco_10A_3,150,0,HENRY,Well and were not mad at you either
Waco_10A_3,151,0,MR_KORESH,Well but your show of arms is definitely bigger than my show of arms So in Psalms 18 the psalm has made very plain when it says I will love the Lord for he is my rock and my salvation my buckler and the horn of my salvation It says I will call upon him so shall I be delivered from my enemies for they were too strong for me And the day of my calamity and this is a calamity really they prevented me And then it goes on to talk about a terrible event that takes place afterwards because you know you all guys are too big for me You know your laws are more numerous than the Ten Commandments you know your weapons are bigger your forces are stronger
Waco_10A_3,152,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,153,0,MR_KORESH,You know But not really You see not really You know Elijah in his day the king of Israel was having to face the Moabites and the Hittites and they were outnumbered But what Elijah said was they that be with us are more than they that be with them because unbeknown to the forces of the heathen who were so boistering of their superior power they did not see the invisible forces of God the angels of God you know just like in the days of ancient Hezekiah
Waco_10A_3,154,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,155,0,MR_KORESH,When the Assyrian armies came into Judea they kept saying to Hezekiah now do not deceive your people but have all of them come out to me and well take you to a land likened to your own and the land flow with milk and honey Dont let Hezekiah deceive you saying that your God will deliver you Anyway what happened was as Hezekiah had listened to the Prophet Isaiah Hezekiah had repented his sins asking God for forgiveness And Hezekiah prayed to God saying Lord God of heaven thou art the only true and living God and all the gods of the earth are idols and they are no gods Now weve come to the birth and theres no strength to bring forth so please save us and deliver us that all the world may know that there is a true and living God is Israel So what took place was is that that night the angel of the Lord went forth and smote 185 000 of their warriors and they perished You see we all know Christ is coming soon
Waco_10A_3,156,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,157,0,MR_KORESH,That gospels been preached for a long time hasnt it
Waco_10A_3,158,0,HENRY,Um hum It certainly has
Waco_10A_3,159,0,MR_KORESH,Yes And everyone is supposed to be like Christ arent they
Waco_10A_3,160,0,HENRY,Right
Waco_10A_3,161,0,MR_KORESH,Okay But the question is is the world ready for the coming of Christ in glory Well God never said he would come in glory the second time The scriptures tell us as the Gospel of Peter tells us look for the salvation that shall be brought to you in the end of the world at the revelation of Jesus Christ We find in Hebrews Paul tries to explain to the Christian church that we who are of the spirit dwell in the heavenly sanctuary a sanctuary where the man of this world can never contaminate they cannot pollute it they cannot contaminate it because it revolves around God who speaks through his word the seven seals And you know like I say unless we fear God unless we fear his word
Waco_10A_3,162,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,163,0,MR_KORESH,you know the appearance of the thing just like 2 000 years ago who really believed that Christ was Messiah
Waco_10A_3,164,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_10A_3,165,0,MR_KORESH,You know
Waco_10A_3,166,0,HENRY,Thats right
Waco_10A_3,167,0,MR_KORESH,And why did he have to die He says father I pleadeth that thy remove this cup from me But if it be not removed except I drink it not my will but they will be done Taken from Psalm 60 where it says Lord thou has shown thy people hard things Well the seven seals are pretty hard things Thou has made us to drink the wine of astonishment Psalm 75 Messiah is talking to the to the heathen and he says I said to the fools do not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for know that promotion comes neither from the east nor the west nor the south by the north in Orion past Orion in heaven in the northern part of the universe the father has exalted and promoted Christ above all heaven hasnt he
Waco_10A_3,168,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,169,0,MR_KORESH,Right Okay It says in Psalm 75 Were having a lot of babies crying around here now
Waco_10A_3,170,0,HENRY,Are they okay
Waco_10A_3,171,0,MR_KORESH,I guess theyre Why are the babies crying so much [Unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] Yeah can you give them some bottle or some some breast or something [Unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] Please Yeah she wants some milk Okay Anyway so were stuck in a corner right now my friend
Waco_10A_3,172,0,HENRY,How do you feel right now
Waco_10A_3,173,0,MR_KORESH,Well
Waco_10A_3,174,0,HENRY,Physically
Waco_10A_3,175,0,MR_KORESH,In Psalms I dont know its like this Christ says he has the key of David right
Waco_10A_3,176,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,177,0,MR_KORESH,He can open and no one can shut
Waco_10A_3,178,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,179,0,MR_KORESH,Its taken from the prophecy of Isaiah 22 for God promises to overthrow the ungodly of his land Hes going to take away the power of the ungodly and reestablish his kingdom
Waco_10A_3,180,0,HENRY,Uh huh
Waco_10A_3,181,0,MR_KORESH,He says in that day Ill rise up my servant Yeah he says Eliakim which means Godll raise up Eliakim It says on that day Ill lay upon his shoulder the key of David and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open And it says they shall lay upon him all the glory of his fathers house Now unless you know who Eliakim is you wont know who his father is But it says you shall lay upon him the offspring and the issue But you know what that is Thats children isnt it Offspring
Waco_10A_3,182,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,183,0,MR_KORESH,Yeah Well thats where you get the first seal at The man on the white horse the first thing that I try to teach people in Psalms in the first seal you know the man on the white horse is that youve got a bow right
Waco_10A_3,184,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,185,0,MR_KORESH,And hes also got a crown right
Waco_10A_3,186,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,187,0,MR_KORESH,He goes forth conquering and to conquer right
Waco_10A_3,188,0,HENRY,Um hum
Waco_10A_3,189,0,MR_KORESH,Well then what happens is you find the truth of that in the 45th Psalm [Unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] Theyre on the roof with ropes
