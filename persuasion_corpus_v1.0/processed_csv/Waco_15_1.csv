Waco_15_1,5,0,TAPE,If we take a look at the record of John the Gospel writer John take chapter 7 We see in scripture John writes that after certain events after these things Jesus walked in Galilee He would not walk openly he would not walk in jewry Would not walk amongst the Jews because the Jews sought to kill him We might wonder why Wasnt Christ such a good man Now the Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand His brethren therefore said unto him Depart hence and go into Judaea that they disciples also may see the works that thou doest For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly If though do these things shew thyself to the world For neither did his brethren believe in him Strange statement isnt it Its funny how that when men live and have to deal with realities of life that even a man like Christ could have to meet with unbelief even from his own brethren Then Jesus said unto them My time is not yet come but your time is always ready And Im sure most fellow Bible students will agree the time referred to is the time of his crucifixion They wanted to kill him and he didnt want to show himself openly Then Jesus said to unto them excuse me Verse 7 The world cannot hate you but me it hateth because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil Go ye up unto this feast I go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come When he had said these words unto them he abode still in Galilee But when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret You would wonder why a man like Christ would have something to hide I mean surely the angels would protect him obviously I personally think a lot of things about this strange character and disposition of character But were sure in being Christian that Christ knew what he was doing [Unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] Then the Jews sought him at the feast and said Where is he
Waco_15_1,6,0,RACHEL,Well can you let them find out if they see the stretcher if they took the stretcher out
Waco_15_1,7,0,TAPE,And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said He is a good man others said Nay but he deceiveth the people

Waco_15_1,14,0,JIM,Oh
Waco_15_1,15,0,TAPE,political network didnt they
Waco_15_1,16,0,JIM,Okay Well were sending it
Waco_15_1,17,0,TAPE,And a pretty strongly religious spectrum although they had no actual political power They were subject to the relevant government and thus to the really traditional rabbinical laws Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught And Jews marvelled saying How knoweth this man letters having never learned Now in the days of Israel most scholars and teachers will agree that the schools of Israel ordained by the Sanhedrin and also the Pharisees were schools similar to the ones of our own theological schools of today of which a careful student of scripture observes that no where is it written in the gospel that Christ ever attended these schools But at the age of 12 he did enter into the temple and had a most unique and interesting discussion with the religious leaders of which they were quite amazed at such a young lads knowledge of scripture Now this man was teaching something no doubt Christ that is that inspired the people to say you know how knoweth this man you know letters having never learned They marvelled Jesus answered them and said My doctrine is not mine but his that sent me Now what does that mean My doctrine is not mine but his that sent me

Waco_15_1,171,0,JIM,Okay All right Just hang on here with me
Waco_15_1,172,0,RACHEL,Okay
Waco_15_1,173,0,TAPE,for they know not what they do [indiscernible] which is a point that were fixing to get into quite heavily Father into thy hands I commit my spirit Taken from Psalms 31 we begin to see that Christ is well versed at the scripture just like the gospels tell him when [indiscernible] Always referring I guess to temptation by stating it is written It is written It is written Now what is this spirit of Christ Well they pierced his side Out of his side came blood and water I get another mystery This became something to do with eating his body and drinking his blood Some implements for the church But what do these things really mean Well after weve read Acts and learned of the power of pentecost the cloven tongues of fire that came upon the apostles who by mercy through Christ were given another chance to recover from their falling We learn through Romans that there is a righteousness of God in Christ declare his righteousness We learn in Corinthians I and II we learn in Ephesians Galatians Philippians Oh we have such a wealth of information of such intelligent men who speak sometimes very deep mystical things about a God who is in the form of humanity who is the Son of God who sits at the right hand of God in the highest court of the universe
Waco_15_1,174,0,RACHEL,Keep the kids quiet
Waco_15_1,175,0,TAPE,Who promises that one day hell come again Well the last living apostle [indiscernible] this great controversy And I might add those who persecuted Christ who would not hear him no matter what sign was given also persecuted his disciples And finally we end up in the Book of Revelation where John the last living disciple on the Isle of Patmos being a prisoner for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ which no doubt are the things Jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the Pharisees and Sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure He being on this Isle of Patmos a prisoner on the Lords day had a vision And it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the Lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit And he is told to write the seven churches of Asia of which we can see clearly in the scriptures that they were given specific and direct messages from Christ And in each one of these messages Christ specifically told the churches what he would have them to do Now we know that Christ is the only man in scripture who ever kept the law of God perfectly We know that because weve heard the writings of the apostles But sad to say the religious leaders of his days and the majority of the populace of his days didnt think so Its funny how that is Its kind of like people always like to build the sepulchers of the dead prophets and garnish their tombs But yet they hate and kill the living prophets Only God knows why that is But nonetheless the church of Ephesus Smyrna Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia Laodicea the churches thats involved for anyone to read direct counsel is given beginning with its the age of the church of Ephesus right These things [indiscernible] what happens if the best is given And then the decision is up to those [indiscernible] Christ Each council [indiscernible] even has ear to hear so if you want to know But in here with the spirit [indiscernible] the church Finally we get to the 40th chapter of Revelation
Waco_15_1,176,0,RACHEL,They picked up the stretcher Now theyre on their way back
Waco_15_1,177,0,TAPE,And as soon as scripture becomes [indiscernible] [Tape_continues_playing]
Waco_15_1,178,0,JIM,They picked it up you said
Waco_15_1,179,0,RACHEL,Yeah
Waco_15_1,180,0,JIM,And theyre on
Waco_15_1,181,0,RACHEL,Now theyre on their way back
Waco_15_1,182,0,JIM,Okay Okay good Can you see them
Waco_15_1,183,0,RACHEL,Yeah
Waco_15_1,184,0,TAPE,which was referring to the last part of third chapter of the message of Laodicea He says after these things I saw and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice that spake to me as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said Come up hither and I will show you that which must be hereafter Now the question to every true Christian is this Is John telling us the truth or is John lying to us We know he just gave counsel to the seven churches of Asia which were alive and hopefully in good health when he first gave these letters to them But nonetheless they being of Asia are know wise the same people of us today or even of the oncoming years thereafter So the events of chapter 4 clearly explained by John that his messenger as sent to him stated that he be taken up hither Therefore a door opened in heaven the Bible records And he was to be shown things which must be hereafter sometime after Johns day Now what did he behold in chapter 4 of revelations He says that he was in the spirit He immediately was in the spirit And behold a throne was set in heaven And he states that the throne was occupied Someone sat on the throne And he that sat upon the throne was like a jasper a sardine stone I [indiscernible] say the scripture knows all the way through prophecy all the way through the Bible as far as back as the days of Genesis even to the prophecy of Deuteronomy 32 where it says God is a rock He is our rock And his work is done in truth and in righteousness All the prophets refer to God as a rock Now here we see in Revelation John likewise written it says God has the appearance of a jasper and a sardine stone [Indiscernible] there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald He carefully saw that there were living creatures around the throne saying that God is holy holy holy which was is and is to come God intended all things for which the pleasure they were and are created Now this instruction emphasizes that there is a God a kingdom a judiciary in the respect that John witnesses that there were 24 elders sitting on 24 thrones seems to imply a judgment But uniquely enough in this judgment or in this throne or in this heavenly sanctuary as we see from the rise and fall of the apostles Paul only talks about the heavenly sanctuary the heavenly sign In this sanctuary we see a God a rainbow a throne living creatures stating that God is holy which was is and come the past present and future And that this God this creator of all things is holy and deserves to be worshipped We continue on in chapter 5 to see that I beheld John says the right [indiscernible] that sat on the throne a book or a scroll sealed with seven seals Notice its written on the inside and the backside Well the meaning of these things kind of will be speculated until we have solid proof In other words unless we were there ourselves to see it in detail But what we are allowed to see in the scripture is John also beholds a might angel in this throne room where all these angels thousands ten thousand and thousands and thousands are called together And this mighty angel questions all in heaven Who is worthy to open this book and to loose the seven seals thereof Clearly scripture states no man in heaven neither on earth neither under the earth Of course buried In other words we do have dead in this world you know Was worthy to open neither to look thereon So hey God says in scripture at least John testifies in scripture that the mystery of God his book is sealed Well what happens is as we continue on we see in Chapter 5 that John begins to weep until one of the elders says weep not John Behold the Lion of the tribe of Juda the Root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof Of which we know the lamb being a symbol of Christ is brought to view And John beheld a lamb as it had been slain in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and the elders with seven eyes and seven horns Well whats the meaning of these things
Waco_15_1,185,0,RACHEL,Theyre back
