hey
nobody does anthing from behind bars man
we talked about that before and i told you
i told you <name> he thinks hes god
he isnt nothinn those old creeps have been up to visit me i dont care for em i told them i didnt care for their bullshit
do you belong to a a group or do you have an organization of your own
youll find that out ive messed things up
ive
got a lot of things for people that you have a strong feeling for
ive fowled it up
nothing theres nothing that cant be corrected nothing
i did something that that cannot be corrected
just in the future trying to keep from keep emfrom giving people the wrong kinda drugs
well what can we do in that besides the drugs what uh whats the the alternative
i have no alternative you have lots of alternatives
do you think the drugs are the whole problem its just kinda should deal without deal with people without using medication
no i belive that valium was fine i was very concerned that theyd take valium off the market once you become hooked on it ya know i got into this whole thing in san francisco to raise money [sigh] for the and then it in order to get into it you have to take the valium youve gotta do something so you look like you need disability and then all of a sudden i realize youre hooked on it i didnt know that you would become hooked on it
did you ever take anything else <name>
ive took acid in 68 and couldnt do anthing else i was hallucinating so bad i took angel dust in san francisco unbeknowenst to myself twice people sneaked it on me
howd that effect ya
bad very bad
still get flashbacks from that
i dont think so i you know its i know you people wanna write me off as crazy but
you know
im not that crazy i may be slightly warped who knows everybodys warped to a degree but i am not that crazy
whats that got to do with anything i dont understand what you mean
are you are you trying to tell me the bullshit that i should try to say that the things that happened to <name> can be attributedto drugs its bullshit i will not i will not cop that i pay
do you know that for a fact
i will pay for it i know for a fact my hand will pay for that
well i dont know i mean
i can i could never i cant sleep anywhere i could never sleep with that
do you have any answer for for what happened
i dont know i cant remember
as i say ya know there has to
madness
be reasons when you dont remember things and that would be huh the only logical reason i can think of
i dont know im gonna have to pay for that such a good person
what was uh what were you trying to raise money in san francisco for
[laughs] the people there had decided the way to bring down the system was to let the system support the revolution itself pay for they subsidize everyting else let em subsidize the equipment to manufacture things
uh huh
why did you give up on that
i didnt i i let myself get head over in to deep into the the medication i should im it has bad side effects i didnt think it would do that to me
when were you last in san francisco
seventy three and seventy four
you havent been back since
no
do you still have contacts out there
[laughs_then_sighs] what <name> is not comin through huh
<name> cant be located
yea yea i remember <name>
yea he he apparently uh contacted somebody and said that he knew you pretty well too
yea he knows me he and uh <name>
did you uh work out at the y with them
yea i worked out there
you still goinn down there
now i switched ys i switched up to the williams
how come
oh [sigh] just different scenery
you uh just a runner or
now i uh use to teach martial arts and then i
oh is that right
got into boxing for a while to go along with the the martial arts and then i just sparred a little this summer with some italian guy went back to italy
how uh how deep are you into the martial arts
oh ive been into it since the 50s
what degree are ya
well that i was a black belt in san francisco but that doesnt mean anything its all bull the best is is boxing and and wrestling and judo
you had your own classes though
yea ive taught in san francisco san francisco y but i
still keeping up on that or or have you
oh yeah
swithched completely to boxing
well i uh keep on the martial arts the maming techniques but i i prefer boxing ya know the work out itself
is that more of a workout or do you have to be in better condition for that
ithink you have to be in a hell of a lot better condition and i think a lot of the moves in martial arts are stupid like kicking somebody in the head is comparable to reaching down and punching somebody in the toe brings about as much sense
well can a good boxer take a good karate man
easy easy
really
sure thats why they only allow like if you watch those so called kick boxing matches they make uh the guys they have a mandatory number of kicks they have to kick per round thats so the boxers dont kick their rear
really
yea no karate man see hes got gloveson you cant youre youre main thing with karate is maiming anything other than that its its youre open youre open to get tatooed by a dozen a dozen hooks or whatever from the other guy kicking wears you out
how much difference is there in size can a big uh a little karate guy take a a big boxer er
no no way
can a big karate guy take a little boxer
in a street situation id say yes but in a in a ring it depends on if the karate man had any uh boxing training if he had enough
what if hes just a good street fighter guys been raised in the streets his whole life and learned to fight there
he probably could it depends on how much heart hes got [pause]
thats interesting
well everybody has their opinion and thats my opinion but most people will disagree with me naturally
what would you be ranked in the boxing what what division or what weight
id be heavy weight
you ever are you considered amateur or
or just amateur yea i was too old im forty one i didnt start till i was uh thirty five then they wouldnt let me spar because i was uh or fight because i was too old [laughs]
really
yea so uh i had to have guys at the y train me theres a lot of old timers down there and a lot of new guys comin out of the service so i learned just as much down there as i would have otherwise
you learned it originally in the service
no the y m c a
or the y did
yep boxing
were you ever in a
i was in the marine corp they kicked me out they called me the purple people hater
[laughs] whys that
i hated people people that would step on other people i would beat em up at night id kick em in the kidneys
you knew all the neat tricks huh
well they deserved it they hurt people that were weak and
you still workin out at the williams y now
well i was up until today [chuckles]
how often do you everyday
everyday except wednesdays i hike
just uh when ya say you hike whaddya mean
i take <dog_name> for a walk through the woods
through the woods
mmmm hmmm
rugged hikes or just
oh rugged hikes keep in shape
dog has no problem with that
no hes in good shape
what kinda dog youd say he was
hes a welsh courtney
is that a pretty sturdy little
oh yea hes uh i dont know what uh little short thing hes not very big hes about uh apartment size about all youd want for an apartment hes a one man dog ill have to say hes very loyal
is that right
hes a loyal dog
thats the way to have em
pardon
thats the way to have em
i know i wanted to take him with me but i just i couldnt do it
what uh how did you come about getting where youre at now what made you decide to do that
[sighs] there are things going on in the world and it just things went down different then they were suppose to i just i dont what happened preparations for a long time
where youre at now was preperations for a long time
oh yea it just all went down the wrong way
no not at all our plan was much different than this
ive accomplished absolutely nothing
dont give me that bull fighter for the cause they think im a mad man [laughs]
i disagree with that
well i know what theyll probably portray me as and thats their problem i wont be here to have to deal with it
but what they portray you as and what people perceive you as are completely different things
well it it [sighs]
but chaos is a solution the random factors of the solution
but chaos only works when theres leadership
no chaos works without leaders thats why its chaotic thats why it cant be traced the anonymous act cannot be traced
but theres no direction no uh
there need no be if everyone is a leader
but its constant chaos at that point you need
thats the idea
but in effect how does that help the people
it uses up the system
well i guess thats one [inaudible]
it will be used up my life will be used but it will continue on it will be used up and if theres a here after ill be wating
are there people here that you deal with all the time that know what youre goals are and
i would be a fool to answer that and you knew that
well im just im really trying to to shed some light on the whole thing and where youre coming from and what were going to do here so thats uh
there isnt much time left for me
ya know i really like to know what we could do with uh the dog thats
i wanted <name> or uh <name> to bring him to me let him come and go with me to another reality
well hopefully were gonna get a hold of one or both of those people but the the big problem is how do we get those people to youd
<name> trusts me
well i dont hell have to trust me because i dont trust him that far
well theres one other person that i probably doesnt not even want me to mention his name who is a relative of mine <name>
really
yea but he probably wants no part of me right now [laughs]
how close a relative is he
he married my cousin
have you uh been together before
oh yea weve had walks and such but i dont think he wants any part of me right now
well
i would trust him
what could we do i mean you trust him to what degree
to bring my dog to me
i told you i intend to terminate myself
well i think all of those people would feel the same as i do that
look i had all of those people here last night if i intended there were people walking down the street if i intended to just randomly waste people i could have easily that was not my purpose
well uh uh
would you
i would go in if someone had gave me their word and i knew that they had been consistent in the past i was consistent
well thats only one time i dont think you can really say thats consistency
its consistent enough
[laughs] are you do you thing i am totally crazy giving up the weapons i have nothing i cant even terminate myself
i still think that we should look at this as where were gonna go with the future not where were gonna end theres a lot to the future
im going into the dirt i would like my dog to go with me
that kind of a position well nobody knows who you are
well i dont intend to hurt anyone except myself and i dont intend to hurt my dog other than i know he will only be loyal to me and nobody else will care for him like i have
i have
now youll have to figure that one out
well
i have enough believe me i could rip this place apart
well if they want to come in and try to take me thats fine im im gonna do myself in so thats unnecessary but if they want to battle what the hell a warriors way to go is just as fine a way as any other way to go i dont want to hurt anyone i did but i have decided that just out do it
i think youre being too hard on yourself <name>
no i wasted it
i cant do anything for anyone now
why not
its all over i told you i lost my viability
i just flipped out no i flipped out thats it thats the madman thats a deranged person my viability went down the tubes
well ya know i i know this is your job to try to con me but it just
no im not trying to con you
it just doesnt work
wait now lets get that straight right now
well you tried to con on <name> not being dead i know shes dead
well they gave you false information
i cant be assured of anything anything that you ask me ill try and accomplish
well see thats what i mean nobody can be assured of
i cant trust anybody right now
all i can do is trust myself
well youre gonna have to trust somebody else
id like to trust someone to bring my dog to me
well i told you i intend to die and uh i will i will not hurt anyone that brings the dog to me
well
well hes gonna be the same way when i go to the funny farm or where ever they wanna take me to
but at least you can make some arrangements that you think are are necessary
what do you think you think i should just shoot myself or you guys wanna come in and try to take me
i dont think we should go in either direction i think we oughtta discuss you comin out and [inaudible]
thats insane
[sighs]
im going right [phone_drops_to_floor]
hello
hi
hi
this is henry
okay henry you want to speak to david
yes who is this
its rita again
thank you rita
okay
wait a minute had this ear plug again
what
i said i had the ear plug in again
oh okay
i keep putting the phone with the ear plug
oh okay
okay heres the deal
okay
im going to make this tape now you know some of these younger girls you know they dont want to go you know and i i explained to them i said look i says you know our main thing sarah knows anyway and its the truth you know the truth you know
um hum
and i explained to them again cause you know they the girls have the different rooms and talked to them but i explained to them i said you know our whole purpose is our message we have a message and the worlds ignorant of what we believe in the bible so theyre ignorant about what were doing
um hum
you know
see thats what they anyway im sorry i didnt mean to get off the track
okay
heres the deal so some of the some of the older you know we have quite a few older ladies here too
okay
and i told them i said look i says you know you all you know you all cause they theyve been quite shocked you know i told him i said look you all you all are not really involved in anything you know you all believe the message and believe the truth i says but remember thats the main thing is the truth is what we all stand for
okay
and i says you can probably also help present to the people the truth
um hum
and so you know ive ive been talking to them i said look heres the deal you know you can either witness for god here and probably dont want to listen to us or if you had a chance to to be on the outside you could witness to him there
um hum
you know cause people are going to want to know why weve done these crazy things now next thing we didnt give them a bunch of baloney but i said you know youre the ones that are supposed to be the victims so you know if youre out there you can do a greater witness for god you know being out there to show them that you do want to live cause you know a dead christian is a dead christian
right
a live christian is a witness
um hum
so you know and so i explained to them you know if if if you all can you know realize that see the thing of it is we dont teach that america has to be punished we teach that god grants unto men an opportunity to see his mistake in the light of gods word and then repent of it
um hum
you know and so thats the whole thing so this this is where me and jim had a good relationship on the phone because you know i began to explain things to him he like you is an excellent listener and he began to realize that were not trying to be just radical idiots you know with ragging our head off you know talking about armegeddon and stuff
um hum
you know armegeddon is the prophecies tell you is an end of time when god resurrects all the people that have ever lived and they attack the city of god ezekial talks about it so you know anyway its not a few handsful of maniacs trying to fight thats not armegeddon at all
okay
but anyway so the thing of it is is that you know theres theres you know theres three of them here that are you know deciding on you know whether you know they want to go or not
okay
and so im talking to them a bit more now but so it appears to be like i say i told them what what you promised to do for us you know for us which is for god right
um hum
because youre doing it for our god
um hum
you know for our belief in god
um hum
and and so therefore you know this is the whole reason for the truth anyway is to is to be able to have what we believe known
okay
these people can decide better and then you can ask us questions if were alive
right
and if were gone then you know no no good i agree with you guys you know two children thats the thats the main thing and two two of the women here
okay now thats now remember theyre doing theyre doing this
i understand
no we will but you know that thatll start thatll start the ball rolling and well both reach our goals okay
okay well ill
now
ill tell them that
okay now what i want to do is i want to to get your tape as soon as i can one of the things that were considering because a lot in terms of radio prime time is when the commute is on okay
the what now
when the commuters are driving to work is when prime time is on radioland okay so youre working on the tape and should have it for me soon is that correct
well if i if i get a chance to keep making it
okay
but prime time i thought was the time the people are driving home when they get home in the evening
well
thats prime time
radio i think is is when everybody is going to work dont you think i mean thats when everybody really listens to the radio
well thats thats not really ask ask the producers and theyll tell you opposite but anyway like i said youll be playing the dallas one first right
were going to play dallas and then we hope to go to national right away
okay now cause im sure like you say the subject matterll be intense enough especially if radio stations could broadcast that its coming
exactly
you know and then that way you know yeah we could like you said and arizona will be from 11 to 1 or something right
um hum but
okay thats good
but we want to go on this right away were not going to wait till 11 oclock
oh no with the tape the tape needs to be given to you as early as possible
yes and as soon as we do that were going to go national well go on krld and and then after that well go national
all right and the national will be 11 oclock right
itll be as soon as as right after krld plays it
well how can that be then i mean how are you going to be able to get the tape to to arizona
well were everybody or a lot of a lot of the national radio stations are here you know in this general area so were going to find somebody you know thats a national radio
i see so youre not going to be playing it around 11 or 12 then
were going to play it at 11 and 12 oclock too but you know but you know
well you know if thats
well i told
yeah i
okay so like i say i could more than i could more than last im sure till 12 oclock itll be our time right
okay okay well
like i say thats when well come all out
okay well thats fine
were going to were going to like i say once i get this tape finished and like i said im trying to get it done now i mean i
okay
you know i need to get it hurry up and get it done
okay
and and im pretty sure were going to have two women for you and two children

kind of weak how are you boys doing
how do you feel now
how do i feel now
um hum
just a little pain
well like i was telling jim you know i told jim to to look into that bible i told him to look into revelation 4 and 5 i told him to look into those seals now if you look at the the fifth seal if you look at the sixth seal if you look into isaiah 13 if you look in joel 2 if you look into the back of nahum whats fixing to happen has already been foretold i teach seven seals now whatever that means you know id like to talk with you guys in full id like you to grab a bible sit down and follow me word by word see what the ancients have foresaw and that way wed have a better understanding but i realize that you know most of you are not ready for that youve got your own way of doing things
look
oh im definitely a family person
look henry
youre not going to listen to me are you
i will listen to you
okay youre listening now
yes i am
okay the event that youre now fixing to witness is youre fixing to see a government a government thats been blessed see there was an ancient empire called babylon
um hum
land of the chaldeans and before babylon ruled the then known world god had a people that he brought out of egypt and god had given them laws and statutes and god had stated unto israel which was a cult because they had one leader moses and one right hand man aaron and god says and promised that if they will keep his laws hell make them the head of all nations if they break his laws hell scatter them amongst the nations and the nations of the heathens will rule over them so for many many hundreds of years god forebores his people but finally the days came when israel became worse than the heathens so god arose prophets such as isaiah hosea obadiah malachi zephaniah habakkuk you know these prophets nahum and god foretold in these prophets how that theyd be scattered amongst the nations in the book of daniel daniel was shown while under the chaldean captivity he was shown that the nations of the earth that shall rule over gods people will be symbolized as one great image and the image will be head of gold arms of silver belly of brass legs of iron feet part of iron and part of clay and daniel says to the king nebuchadnezzar the highest ruling position of the land in that day daniel says thou oh king of this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and yet a third kingdom of brass and then a fourth kingdom dreadful and terrible it shall cometh the whole world
um hum
and then there shall be a kingdom that shall be at the ten toes partly strong and partly broken so when rome split up under the nomadic kingdoms it fell into many different kingdoms
um hum
we know it as europe now daniel goes on to explain that while europe is still in existence he goes on to say [indiscernible] behold a stone came and smote the image in the feet and they had gold and silver and brass and iron was all made as the chaff of the summer threshing floors well this stone is the subject of which the book of revelation talks about it talks about that which must be hereafter that god will one day in the future in the end of the world shall come and sit on his throne in heaven and therell be one question asked in heaven the question is who is worthy to open this book the book is in the right hand of god and to lose these seven seals thereof scripture clearly teaches christendom that no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open and he looked thereon
um hum
but the lamb the lamb is symbolized as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns you know god creates things in seven days doesnt he
um hum
okay theres only one many who knows what that book teaches but for the sake of humanity the acid test revolving around the subjects in this book revolve around christ in heaven opening the seals and what is witnessed is a man on a white horse a man on a red horse black and pale dead souls under the altar described to god because of their blood thats been shed and then the time when the sun and moon and stars will be darkened the heavens will part as a scroll and the great man mighty men free men bonded men shall cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb but the great davids wrath has come
um hum
so these subjects are mysteries cause nobody really has a real thorough opinion to really know the real meanings of these things but in chapter 10 after the student of scripture is read and become familiar with the symbols in chapter 10 after talking about an army of 200 million that overthrow the world it talks about a mighty angel coming down from heaven and he has in his hand a little book and its opened and seven thunders are uttered seven thunders and john was told that when theres time no longer this mystery of god this revelation of jesus christ the seven seals will be finished as god has declared to his servants the prophets
um hum
so in this 22nd chapter after a person takes the time to read these things its very clear the statement christ says i jesus have sent my angel to testify to these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david now ancient david was a great king wasnt he
um hum
hes the one that took his little sling stone and slew the great giant goliath
right
yeah okay so what happened was he says behold i come quickly my reward is with me to give it to every man according as his work shall be
um hum
now when christ comes the question is going to be what did the father give him that no other man in heaven was worthy to receive no man was worthy a book right
um hum
god gave him a book a revelation of himself that the father claims hes the author of this book and when the lamb comes hes going to bring this book and mankind is supposed to find out that it is the bible the bible which the prophets of god having spoken by the spirit that god gave them having volumed a testament in regards to those events that must be fulfilled in the latter days now in revelation 13 john witnesses in regards to the seventh seal john sees a beast this beast has a head like a lion a body like a leopard feet of a bear in daniel 7 daniel foretold that the empires of babylon persia greece and rome would be symbolized babylon as a lion persia as a bear greece as a leopard and the fourth beast he said would devour all the three beasts before it and conquer the world now that was rome daniel also says in the days of this kingdom they will kill the prince of the covenant they could change gods times and gods laws and place abomination to make desolate false religion we know the only true religion is the religion of god
um hum
now christ died during the times of rome and on the cross very clearly its written in the gospel records he said father forgive them for they know not what they do
um hum
and then he said into thy hand i commit my spirit and the hand of god has a book the word by the word of god god made heaven and earth and by his word there was prophets the events that youre now witnessing are taking place now what is taking place well in the book of micah it says in that day they shall gather together and they shall say let thine be defiled that they know not the thoughts of the lord neither do they understand his counsel all of the prophets through the book of nahum it talks about messiah it talks about well for instance to make it real simple christ says he has the key of david in revelation so in the book of the psalms for instance psalms 2 david sees a vision of the future of a confrontation between man and mans law
um hum
and god and gods law
um hum
now revelation 13 tells us that theres a lamb like beast thatll rise up having two horns and itll speak as a dragon now weve got to identify what great empire arose up after europe thats a great empire thats lamb like or christian but yet doesnt really tell the truth well the only great empire weve known is the united states of america now back to psalms 2 the psalm says why do the heathen rage you know the heathen dont know god
um hum
they dont know his word
um hum
and they get angry
um hum
it says and the people imagine vain things for the leaders of the earth and the rulers take counsel together against the lord
um hum
and against his anointed
um hum
thats christ you see
um hum
saying let us break his bands asunder now what are the seven bands that christ promises to bring when he comes again the seven seals right
um hum
but zachariah and the other prophets say that the world will not regard these messages of mercy they have no interest in being instructed by anyone but themselves now they say let us break his bands asunder let us cast his cords away from us but scripture says which is taking place right now it says that he that sits in the heavens thats the father you see
um hum
shall laugh for the lord shall have them the heathen in confusion see the heathen dont know what theyre doing and this time they cant be forgiven because this time they willfully reject the subject which so plainly has been laid in the book of revelation a subject which everyone is to be very familiarized with for the latter days and yet theyre to understand by earnest study that these things will remain a mystery until christ comes again
um hum
to reveal these mysteries
um hum
so the heathen and their tactics in dealing with a person based upon rumors and based upon their laws they fail to understand that god also has a law and god also has a kingdom and god also has a key so what takes place it says then shall the lord speak unto them in his wrath thats what happens during the sixth seal
um hum
the sun and moon and stars is darkened the heaven departs as a scroll and the great men of the earth cry to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the reality that they would not know aforetime what god said will be so they end up fulfilling prophecy not knowing what side theyre doing but to the wise when god speaks in his wrath they already know of the events and it says yet have i set my king up on my holy hill of zion so irrespective of what attitude the heathen may take against the truth of the seven seals or the man that is trying to teach the seven seals irrespective gods kingdom the stone god himself is going to intervene and hes going to hit the image in the feet and its all going to blow away and gods going to take the jurisdiction and power from all the great men of the earth and all that the prophets have spoken is to be fulfilled
um hum
now the psalm continues to say i will declare the decree the lord has said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee so we know the anointed one is christ dont we christ is the son of god in psalms 2 right
um hum
and it says the father says to the son ask of me and i will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the earth for thy possession for thou shalt dash the heathen to pieces with a rod of iron and shall break them as a potters vessel now thats pretty bad isnt it
um hum
i mean nobody wants to be hurt do they
no really
so thats why in psalms 2 the subject is clear the mission of the lamb the anointed one is to teach the seals okay
um hum
now the reason why the prophecy is written is because it continues to say now therefore be wise ye rulers of the world be instructed ye judges of the earth serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the son least he be angry and ye perish in the way when is wrath is kindled but a little now im not mad at you guys you know
well and were not mad at you either
well but your show of arms is definitely bigger than my show of arms so in psalms 18 the psalm has made very plain when it says i will love the lord for he is my rock and my salvation my buckler and the horn of my salvation it says i will call upon him so shall i be delivered from my enemies for they were too strong for me and the day of my calamity and this is a calamity really they prevented me and then it goes on to talk about a terrible event that takes place afterwards because you know you all guys are too big for me you know your laws are more numerous than the ten commandments you know your weapons are bigger your forces are stronger
um hum
you know but not really you see not really you know elijah in his day the king of israel was having to face the moabites and the hittites and they were outnumbered but what elijah said was they that be with us are more than they that be with them because unbeknown to the forces of the heathen who were so boistering of their superior power they did not see the invisible forces of god the angels of god you know just like in the days of ancient hezekiah
um hum
when the assyrian armies came into judea they kept saying to hezekiah now do not deceive your people but have all of them come out to me and well take you to a land likened to your own and the land flow with milk and honey dont let hezekiah deceive you saying that your god will deliver you anyway what happened was as hezekiah had listened to the prophet isaiah hezekiah had repented his sins asking god for forgiveness and hezekiah prayed to god saying lord god of heaven thou art the only true and living god and all the gods of the earth are idols and they are no gods now weve come to the birth and theres no strength to bring forth so please save us and deliver us that all the world may know that there is a true and living god is israel so what took place was is that that night the angel of the lord went forth and smote 185 000 of their warriors and they perished you see we all know christ is coming soon
um hum
that gospels been preached for a long time hasnt it
um hum it certainly has
yes and everyone is supposed to be like christ arent they
right
okay but the question is is the world ready for the coming of christ in glory well god never said he would come in glory the second time the scriptures tell us as the gospel of peter tells us look for the salvation that shall be brought to you in the end of the world at the revelation of jesus christ we find in hebrews paul tries to explain to the christian church that we who are of the spirit dwell in the heavenly sanctuary a sanctuary where the man of this world can never contaminate they cannot pollute it they cannot contaminate it because it revolves around god who speaks through his word the seven seals and you know like i say unless we fear god unless we fear his word
um hum
you know the appearance of the thing just like 2 000 years ago who really believed that christ was messiah
thats right
you know
thats right
and why did he have to die he says father i pleadeth that thy remove this cup from me but if it be not removed except i drink it not my will but they will be done taken from psalm 60 where it says lord thou has shown thy people hard things well the seven seals are pretty hard things thou has made us to drink the wine of astonishment psalm 75 messiah is talking to the to the heathen and he says i said to the fools do not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck for know that promotion comes neither from the east nor the west nor the south by the north in orion past orion in heaven in the northern part of the universe the father has exalted and promoted christ above all heaven hasnt he
um hum
right okay it says in psalm 75 were having a lot of babies crying around here now
are they okay
i guess theyre why are the babies crying so much [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] yeah can you give them some bottle or some some breast or something [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] please yeah she wants some milk okay anyway so were stuck in a corner right now my friend
how do you feel right now
well
physically
in psalms i dont know its like this christ says he has the key of david right
um hum
he can open and no one can shut
um hum
its taken from the prophecy of isaiah 22 for god promises to overthrow the ungodly of his land hes going to take away the power of the ungodly and reestablish his kingdom
uh huh
he says in that day ill rise up my servant yeah he says eliakim which means godll raise up eliakim it says on that day ill lay upon his shoulder the key of david and he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open and it says they shall lay upon him all the glory of his fathers house now unless you know who eliakim is you wont know who his father is but it says you shall lay upon him the offspring and the issue but you know what that is thats children isnt it offspring
um hum
yeah well thats where you get the first seal at the man on the white horse the first thing that i try to teach people in psalms in the first seal you know the man on the white horse is that youve got a bow right
um hum
and hes also got a crown right
um hum
he goes forth conquering and to conquer right
um hum
well then what happens is you find the truth of that in the 45th psalm [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] theyre on the roof with ropes
what
theyre on the roof with ropes right now
no no
the guys are seeing them right
no theyre on the roof with ropes
no no thats not possible
theyre right up there
steve like i say i feel so sorry for you guys
what we want what were hoping to do
i know what you want but you dont understand look at how much look did jim jones ever get this kind of slander look
we dont want anybody we certainly dont want you to be slandered
listen let me explain again
okay
okay look in psalms 45 gods the one speaking and when you come up hither to my church see its the spirit and the world the world is bad there is no temple on god to be honest the temple of god must be in you and it must be in truth spirit and in truth okay when you come up hither youll see god on a throne thats whats written isnt it when you read things you dont really see it you just see it in your mind dont you
um hum
and our mind must be renewed with the knowledge of god correct
um hum
thats why god has chosen to use scripture as a means for men to see his mind
um hum
so in the 45th psalm when you come up hither and you can look at the father spiritually and you hear the 45th psalm speak it says my heart see the father gives me the book right and opens the first seal about the white horse
um hum
so then i show you psalms 45 it says my heart is indicting a good manner i speak of things which i have made touching my king you know who the fathers king is dont you its christ
um hum
it says my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
uh huh
now how does god want to speak he wrote a book didnt he
um hum
thats why his tongue is the pen of a ready writer
um hum
he says to the son he says thou are fairer than the children of men so thats his opinion isnt it
yes
he says grace is poured into thy lips now how are men required to be saved in the latter days whos going to come and whats he going to teach the seven seals right
um hum
and who gave him the seven seals to teach the father right
um hum
and all that receive his testimony will learn the prophets and all the books pertaining to these seals and theyll receive grace
um hum
unmerited favor for salvation
um hum
so therefore have god blessed thee forever but then it says gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty and in that majesty ride prosperously because of truth now what did he ride what does the king ride in the first seal what does he ride
the white horse
he rides the white horse
um hum
so theyre on the roof for sure now right
well why why are people jumping all around on the roof
there is nobody on your roof there is nobody there is
lets get back to the psalm then so you can get a better picture of the way i think okay so in psalms 45 it says with thy glory and majesty ride prosperously because of truth now what is the truth that the father gave him that says hes going to ride prosperously the seven seals right
um hum
okay meekness and righteousness it says thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things why because the father gave me this book
um hum
the father gave me the book and it talks terrible things whats going to happen to the heathen that resist resist against the will of god the word of god
um hum
okay finally it says thy arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies i mean you know what arrows does he have a bow in the first seal he does doesnt he
um hum
okay whereby the people fall under thee this says thy throne o god is forever and forever the [indiscernible] is a right scepter thy love is righteousness and hate is wickedness therefore god thy god have anointed you with the oil gladness above thy fellows so is christ the son of god
yes
and hes god isnt he
um hum
okay now it goes on to talk about his marriage it says upon my right hand is stand the queen in gold of ophir

okay
steve steve henry
hello
hi steve steve
yes
this is henry
oh hi henry
how are you doing
im on the tired side little bit
oh i guess so
little bit slow tonight
okay couple of things i wanted to bring up david mentioned that he was going to try to do that audiotape is he working on that
you know what i i just about 2minutes ago i was going to go lay down for a few minutes and i went past him and he was almost snoring he he fell asleep
oh he did
yeah
okay
so are you working on that or i mean i or i mean have you checked or found out anything about it or
well he said he was going to try to to give us a a tape and he had asked somebody to try to go and get some equipment from
okay yeah i i see
the recording studio
i see something is here right now so thats apparently what its part of
okay is is he i really have a concern because he was you know he was in in great pain and agony you know when i was talking to him earlier
uh huh
and but you know part of the problem is like he said every time that he coughs or laughs or something like that that he feels that he starts bleeding again
he said that
well [gap] for for what theyre telling me i guess hello
yes [gap]
[gap] oh something i dont know whats whats happening i wonder
yeah
is that at your end or
no its probably at your end
well theres nobody around the the phone here i dont get it
uh huh
im looking around here right now okay it sounds actually better i dont know what it kind of cleared up or something here
um hum
okay okay you were you were saying yeah oh i tell you what im just so worn out im having a hard time even talking here
okay well let me let me say this the the two or the lady that brought the the last two kids indicated that their car is almost out of gasoline
oh it is
yeah let let me find out then i guess i havent been with it just too long here i was starting to lay down there and i was let me find out what theyre doing and ill try to do that okay
okay
just a minute
okay
just a minute
henry
yes
so have you made progress with doing the tape thing or
yes as a matter of fact i mean we we encountered some difficulty but but
yeah
uh huh
yeah
and what were trying to work out is were trying to get him some time on the national christian broadcasting network
the national christian broadcasting network
yes which has several thousand radio stations throughout the country
okay
now that is is based in phoenix arizona
in phoenix arizona
but you know their headquarters but when we called out there theres nobody there so we sent agents out to go to the peoples house and get them out of bed or wherever theyre at
uh huh
so that we can initiate this
i see so was he wanting to do that yet tonight or
well he wanted to he was going to record the the cassette for us
uh huh
and then he assured me
yeah
uh huh
i see could you be careful of the cord there i think thats maybe what the problem is someone was bumping into this the cord in the phone is bad
oh okay
okay yeah careful careful there hello
yes
okay okay let me see and then were right now hes fallen asleep i see they brought a couple of the things is there any way i could leave him maybe sleep for 1 hour
okay but but i have a concern steve and the
yeah
concern that i have you know is that you know his health may be deteriorating okay so
okay
okay thats
and then she said she wants there herself asking if if they cant do something in that area she was just whispering over here to me so i i think between her and i were going to ask them about that you know getting that kind of attention or something or see if theres more that could be done to help out there
okay okay and we are ready to provide that but
okay
were going to have to take him out of there
uh huh
okay and i want you to be thinking in terms because at some point the responsibility you know for the entire group is probably going to shift to your shoulders steve
i see
and and you know i know theres an awful lot of people there a lot of children
right
we want to between you and us between you and me we need to try to coordinate this so that we can effect what
right
okay is there any way then can can you call me back in an hour
sure
oh that would be great because i think what im going to do is even lay down here and im going to have somebody here wake me up then or if if the phone rings im just going to make sure that i hear it just so i dont fall off too deeply in sleep or something
okay
okay
well she said he never he passed out before he gave the next couple that were to be going so i dont know what to really do right now can can we just wait for 1 hour
okay does
and then and call me and im going to have them at least have you know a number of them ready so that he can just say well you know these two are going next then
okay

and so forth hold on let me check on one other thing on that stretcher okay
were shooting for 130 on the broadcast rachel

okay
christian broadcast network and thats going you know like i dont hundreds of stations they have okay

yes its national
oh is it
oh yeah uh huh absolutely we checked

okay and then theyre also going to do it on krld which is 1080
krlt
d as in david
oh im sorry
yeah and thats 1080
okay
now you know if you got two radios youll hear it on both

okay and were shooting for 130
okay
so you got to kind of just hang in there and
okay
okay
um hum all right
you guys got to kind of help us facilitate it
okay ill let everybody know
yeah and i was hoping theyd move that truck up there while we were on the phone so you could tell me you saw it but
oh you mean on your end
yeah i mean i was hoping theyd drive it up there i passed the word down for them to to bring that stretcher up
um hum
and so so we could get it in there but
oh you mean ahead of time
yeah you know
uh huh
um hum
oh i see um hum
yeah yeah 130 is when were playing the message [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] hold on a second rachel
all right theyre going to try for 130 but hes going to call us
okay rachel
yes
the program on the christian broadcast radio okay
um hum
starts at 106
106 okay
now thats when theyre going to announce that theyll be playing it at 130
okay
so you might turn it on at 106
all right
and and the reason theyre doing that they said is to get a wider audience
okay
so in other words instead of just starting it theyre telling everybody this is going to be on so they can get as many listeners as possible
all right
yeah do you can you see out the front window
yeah if i get up
okay well i want you to keep an eye to see if that truck comes up with the stretcher

well lets put it this way theres a mans name on there thats that he went by another name and he went by 3 different names
uh huh
and theres 3 different names on my birth certificate and they had a file out in oklahoma city that each of them contributed 25 million dollars and this son of a bitch picked it up and never he gave it to me now i dont know what the hell he did with the money but it sure is but ive seen security and ive seen kbg agency and ive seen went through security checks and the one thing about it is thats exactly how they get the money they firnd some son of a bitch due to inherit alot and then they move in as the parents
i see
now i dont know very much but thats the way i would do it now you understand what im saying
i hear ya <ht01_first_name>
but uh i dont know what the shits goin on all im saying is this is what i was offered i go on their word and so

okay excuse me can someone give me a kleenex all right like i say [indiscernible] and on these [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] the main thing is the truth okay
hey david
so what happened with the krld broadcast of it
the krld
yeah
oh broadcast of the tape
yeah
oh i dont know i thought we well were going to go on nationwide thats part of the network you know how it goes on
oh i see
yeah it will all be on it will be on like i mean this is the biggest christian broadcasting network in the world and the guy theyre dealing with is craig smith
yeah
out of phoenix and hes going to do it
yeah
yeah
its just
youll be able to hear it im going to call you when when its happening
and it will be on krld
its going to be on 1010 am write this down
1010 am
and its kbbw
waco
waco
yeah
thats just the one in waco its everywhere its a network
all right
well okay
okay well
is that the women and children would come and then and then the guys would come one by one with you know because its not that cold now anyway
okay
without any bulky jackets or anything with their hands up because that way you know it would be seen that theres no hanky panky or anything like that on the guys parts
well i dont know if i can lead the way i mean
well you can be part of the group
yeah
you know if you cant walk wed provide you with a stretcher and two of your able bodied men can you know carry you out and you know youd be a intrical part of the group you know what im saying
right
maybe you want to be in the center of your group and two of your men carrying you out but i mean youre there with them
yeah
well what we can do is we can send our guy up to the gate
okay
and if you all will or or a couple of guys at the gate if you all will hand him you know get him give him a stretcher
um hum
then they then they can they can bring me out then
well i i told you jim i would work something out with you remember
i i know you did
and i told you you know that wed wed do this getting the children out first
right
right then wed negotiate
right
and you know like i said everything that i try to do is i try to emphasize that the people that stay with me dont stay with me because of me
um hum
they stay with me because of the truth and unless you know where the truth begins you see
yeah
or unless it can be tested by being out and being around thats one of the only two ways people can see why people stand for what they stand for
thats right
so you know
well youve been you all been a lot better than i ever see in the other cases
uh huh
right
uh huh
right
no were going
yeah i see
right
well let me let me give you an approximate head count on the remaining children all right
okay
okay lets see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 theres over 20 children remaining
okay 20 children
yeah
how about women
and i have to be honest with you i have to really count
okay
i dont know
okay well give me
theres a lot
give me give me a ballpark just give me an idea i can so i can
forty fifty
forty women okay forty to fifty okay
forty fifty women maybe how many men approximately
forty five
forty five fifty forty five fifty
okay forty five fifty men
yeah
okay now how about
i mean you know like theres theres over 150 people
okay
well im the only one that that cant walk so
okay okay well do we can get a stretcher in there to you okay and i
oh well let let two guys bring the stretchers in
well maybe well have sita meet them or something
have what
you know have sita meet them at the gate or well bring it in to you
yeah
well work it out
yeah okay you can just meet them down at the road
well okay we can get them to the gate maybe and then you could have two guys walk down and get them or something
yeah and then and then they can they can bring me out
yeah okay
because like i said weve got two nurses here anyway
yeah okay we can work that out
two like rns and one of thems just like a helper nurse
okay ill ill get something so we can get that to you so you can get out on that
when was my last blood pressure check does anybody remember [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible] yeah
how is it
could you could you get her to get that that lady and and see how my blood pressure was when she last checked it
ninety over
it was 90 over 40 [indiscernible]
ninety over forty okay ninety something like ninety over forty i guess i should have it taken again
yeah
i mean
well i started i started you know we started cleaning the wounds and everything too
okay
and yeah i heard on the radio the police officer said that he he shot me twice in the stomach
um hum
he must have recognized me or something
yeah
and and
so is krld going to be able to are they going to are they going to connect with this too or
yeah the tapes are going to krld both krld is going to play it
uh huh
and the christian broadcast network kbbw
all right
so you can get two radios two into each one and theyll both play them
oh i see okay
and ill alert you ahead of time okay
all right
and whens this going to start
well it wont be yet what happens is they have to listen to the tape at krld you know is not finished listening to it the christian broadcast network listened to it
right
okay now were now have dispatched your preamble okay you know
uh huh
the message we just made okay
right
and then craig smiths show doesnt start until a little after 1
okay
okay so i mean hes the guy were dealing with so his shows a little after 1
okay
yeah yeah the and the reason they got to listen you know so they make sure theres no obscenities on there
oh yeah definitely
the fcc rules you know say that that you know what i mean
exactly well im not i mean
thats okay i understand im just im just telling you the reason
i mean i tried to make it as as simple and as compact
as much as i but you know i just said i told you its very limited on that tape
i understand
the wealth of information is really a thousandfold over that
the truth
all right
okay rach go and and its going to take her a while its a big place here
oh i understand
and go get a all a head count of of all the women and and the guys too right
okay the two wounds is a guy got a braise wound on the leg
okay
and and one guy got a braise wound in the in the arm
okay
i mean its kind of like in the wrist like kind of like what mine is i got one on the wrist too
okay you got the wrist the lower abdomen
right its but see like i say it went it went it went kind of towards the side
yeah
and like i said i think it broke my
pelvis
pelvic bone yeah
david do all the people agree to come out with your with your
i i explained it to them thats why you know two ladies already came out
yeah well we knew that
i told them i said look weve got theres one thing above all and that is the truth
right
you when isaiah said you know lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing they shall see eye to eye see everyone already knows all those prophecies
um hum
theres seven eyes of the lamb right
right
and so theres just you know one complete truth that all the prophets have been foreseeing and ezra didnt want this truth
um hum
so
well i was i know i know you arranged that and i was what i was concerned about that you know the place is so
well most of most of like the most of the girls the young girls you know they do not trust they system you know
oh sure
so thats why they said you know no we dont want to go out
um hum
you know until until we see it
i understand it
yeah
no
okay that that was our
like i say well go well go around the head count to and
yeah
and and get this all totally resolved
hey that
i mean like like for instance we just we just heard a shot a few minutes ago right
you heard a shot
yeah but what happened was who was that [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] it was a it was a guy that he was he grabbed a pistol and it didnt have no clip or nothing in it
oh it was an accident
and yeah but you know its i thought oh no i mean last thing in the world we need
well listen you
and he had pulled the trigger it didnt have a clip in it but it had a round in a chamber
okay well listen i think thats something you can look at us we didnt we heard the shot out there we didnt do anything
yeah yeah
you know and i mean right
kind of got a lot of things to tell you you know
i mean thats how much we trust you
right
that we we hear a shot the the agents the fbi the atf are out there theyre not reacting to that because we told them not to
well youre some good guys
right
and i want
i told you jim
well like i say these arent crazy people
oh i know it we know that
you know there these are people that have had high paying jobs that are very highly intellectual they
hey we know that
so theyre reasoning people you know you might think that the original settlers of this country were you know people that were trying to obtain freedom because of european oppression right
um hum
remember how this government did to the indians
right
you know i mean its sometimes its really a real picture of attitude to really identify what is really right and whats really wrong but thats where the point of reasoning comes in
right
and thats what we try to establish here is
hey youve been
let us reason together the scripture says

good well i dont think they are gonna either i understand there is a warrant for you you you your aware of that right
hmh
have you ever been arrested before
yes
no i aint going to let them take me
well lets talk about that what whats the problem with that
the problem
yes
i cant stand jail
they serve a warrant on me and take me in
and you go right back out on bond
whos going to throw the bond
i aint going to let him take me
well would you like to go out on bond
i dont want to go period
ok i understand that but lets lets talk realistically ok if if if they serve the warrant and thats just a formality ok the warrant is a piece of paper alright you understand that right
yes
i guess you served a warrant on them and they dont even leave their house
everytime if i had a warrant served on me they always took me to jail and i stayed there until i got out on bond whatever happened
the ones im in trouble with
sure theyll work with you
not the ones who put the warrant on me wont
it aint no start either
they aint nobody going to see me responsible for nothing
i dont i dont understand what you said <name>
i said there aint nobody that thinks im responsible for anything
well i think they will if you if you do the right thing
i have done the right thing until until last night
no
this is one isolated incident are you going to have breakfast this morning
no
would you like to
no
how about the baby
shes fine
is she going to get breakfast this morning
i done fed her fantastic
what did you feed her
her bottle
you know how to do that
give her her bottle
yes
yes
i never had much time for that but
i have done fed her two bottles and changed her diapers so shes pretty well taken care of right now
youre kind of a domestic guy you know i i never get home hardly enough hardly to get involved in any of that stuff did you did you warm the stuff
its already warm i dont refridgerate it
uh huh hows hows that baby doing now
i get her in there in bed
huh sounds like a good kid shes sleeping huh
yes i kept her under the electric blanket so shes warm
mhm mhm whats whats her name
<name>
her <name>
mhm mhm and and you dont care for breakfast this morning
mhm mhm no
i dont know
my side of which story
well whatever you want to talk about if the warrants a problem or a girlfriend problem or whatever it is
both problems
ok which do you want to talk about first
it dont matter
mhm mhm
thats the biggest problem
ok what do you what do you think is going to happen if they serve a warrant on you
theyre going to take me to jail take me to court give me a little time
have you got an attorney
no
you have you have any money for an attorney
no
yes i know
so whats the biggest problem there i think the biggest problem from what you said earlier is you dont wanna you dont wanna go to jail right
mhm mhm
get bonded out they serve me a warrant they take me in and and get me to believe that i be just walking throught the door and walking back out
yes yes
i dont
i guess you can do what you want to
its hard to believe anybody
i did
whats whats your ideas on it
whats my ideas
yes
i dont have any
well what if if we did about what you and i talked about earlier
i dont want to be taken in
i stil want to talk to my <name>

im going to give her a break
is is it alright if i talk to her for fifteen seconds
sure i dont have any problem with that but do you want me to work on the warrant i want to know if thats what you want you dont seem that interested

in 88 i told him i said i said shabaz look at me i said you know im not a big guy i said you know of course this is back then i said you know were innocent i said what if what if they convict me and send me to prison ive never been to prison before this time and i said you know what if some big guy bubba gets me in there and you know bends me over and does something wicked to me and gives me aids i said wont you feel bad he goes you should have been you know hes a black guy and goes you should have been thinking that about that before you went out there on that mt carmel
[laughs]
oh boy i dont need to laugh
uh huh
but he afterwards he tried to turn around and sue waco i mean i mean theres some good attorneys
um hum
and theres some that are really bad
well youre right
and its just like wow they got like especially people that are you know like minorities and are trying to prove something double you know
um hum thats true
they dont they forget that equity is not exploiting oneself above the other its equity
right
okay
the women and their remaining children
okay
okay and we said we was going to put them like in a vista so you can see them because we got clear visibility now
okay
and that way youll know there aint no bombs on them or something like that because i know they they think we got a bunch of bombs here
okay
and then lets see and then the guys well bring those out one by one with their hands up
okay
that will be good for tv
um hum well
and no well like the well i know you dont want to wear them want them to wear loose jackets or nothing or i mean you know
well we trust you but you know
well yeah but still
we want to make sure that everybody is you know that nobody has nobody makes any mistakes
we trusted we trusted i always trusted law enforcement too
okay
but i know that when they get when they think they know something they coming banging in the doors
um hum
see thats why thats why so thats why i welcomed robert over so you know its just funny about humanity i did i did everything for robert gonzales hoping that he would you know get back with you guys and
well see youre the key to this thing okay and and because
if he had if he had taken my warning when i told him see i told him that morning i said now robert you know you know ive showed you the truth right out of the book
um hum
i said i only showed you a small part of it
um hum
but you know i would because you know like i told him i said you can come home for 2 weeks we have the 2 week course when a person decides they really want to know it then we give them 2 weeks and then we send them away
um hum
the reason being is is that by sending them away theyre able to get out of our influence and get under other peoples influences
right now what
and then they can
what about what about the men are you going to send them out one by one in the same fashion
well how do you want it
yeah thats thats fine
i mean you know definitely the you know the men are more dangerous then the women so difference is you know the the i mean like i say i was just concerned
okay
on how you feel in regards to whether theyre wearing coats or not i mean its kind of cold but if they got a coat on or something like that you might think they got a bomb or something you know so that way if they if they came out without their coat on and i dont know how do you suggest it
well let me find out if if we want to have them one by one or if we want to have them two at a time and and then if we have somebody other than yourself thats hurt that needs to be carried out then i need to know how many people were talking about that are in that kind
right
of a situation in addition to yourself
when we get when we get to that point then well tell you
okay thats fine i dont have a problem with that thats fine
well like i was trying to tell that you all had the reports that we had only so many children here and so i was telling jim now thats not true your your dad is not correct said well how many you got well i said well im not telling you you know its a card game you know at first like this its a card game
okay but i dont have a
so
all right
it does take energy out of you to talk though
sure it does sure it does
okay do you all have them yet
all right now heres the thing
okay
she okay do you see them i mean do you got a confirmation [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] theyre theyre loading the van now
okay now remember
theyve met up
okay the the two the two units have met up and theyre loading up the van
remember you know dont handcuff those old ladies you know what i mean
okay
i mean let me explain to you theyre theyre ones in her later sixties and ones in her seventies theyre both in their seventies okay
theyre in their seventies
yeah there is some other old women here too and you know they they love the truth and everything but theres
sure
theres a lot of things you know that that they dont know
sure
and so you know like im saying you know dont treat them like criminals
okay okay
okay okay
and you know they do because like i say theyve studied for years
um hum
and even though theyve studied for years and at one time they may have been real bright you know when when theyve learned this message a lot of it goes over their head
sure sure
and its just a part of the human decay of our
thats right
minds and our brightness
exactly
okay well good good im glad you know that you chose them you know to be the
well no i asked them
okay well good
you know and i i told them i said look i said heres the deal you know so far jim has been real good and so far this guys been you know and and were not were not dead yet i mean no ones been shooting on us you know youve
um hum
so far kept your word
um hum
you know weve had a lot of weird spooky things but you know so
well i know but you know once we [indiscernible] you know and we gave you our word that it was going to be in a certain fashion when you kept saying theres somebody on the roof you know somebody with a rope and stuff like that
well there was it wasnt a it was it was our guy
uh huh uh huh
so he got scolded for that because you know
[laughs] yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense
it was our fault you know
yeah
okay
that way the two children get to speak to their mother
okay thats fine
thats fine we can do that
i mean jim im sorry with jim
okay thats fine thats not a problem we can do that
okay then im going to im going to turn the radio on here for a second im going to shut my eyes just for a little bit so i can regenerate
okay thats fine
and because i really need to i need to
okay and ill call you back
i mean i i spoke as clear and as strong as i could on that and i put it up close to my mouth too so it it makes me sound kind of high but they can they can re edit it you know they can anyway theyll know what to do with it okay thanks a lot
okay youre welcome
we really appreciate it
theyre on their way over here now so we should be in good shape
okay give us a call when you get when you get up there
okay ill call you later
thanks henry god bless you
thank you okay
bye
you too bye bye
and thats fine and i have no problems with that
okay
but i have a problem with you staying there all day
well
and when i say i have a problem i would like
this is why this is why you agreed to play this tape right because you really have no intention of playing it right
i told these people to trust you all
okay now heres the deal though you know you do understand the importance to us for this what i have to say to be gotten out now were not terrorists i mean youre not and we dont have no hostages here
i understand
i mean the children thats kind of like a hostage cause like i say theyre too young to make their decisions
um hum
and i dont i dont agree with that even if theyre my own see so the thing of it is is that like i say ive been faithfully sending them out not just because im trying to to to buy time but because i just dont want them involved in this
um hum
you know and trying to to walk the middle of the road to make it as fair for us you know and as fair for you but actually on my side im going to make it fair for me first just like your your side youre going to make it fair for you first so you see we both know where were coming from on that area youve got me okay like you say you know were sitting here listening to the radio and everyone on the radio keeps continually saying you all are going to storm us you all sent you sent you know this is what theyre saying now im not saying that thats true
okay
see so youre being if youre honest and youre being dirty dealt with just like i have been dirty dealt with you see and its a different situation but still its the same thing
well
theyre saying that youre going to do something and its going on national radio state radio at least and people are out there listening and youre not correcting it you know and theyre saying well the fog is a good cover and this is going to happen and and weve seen these many vehicles and theyre moving up and and you know well youre not youre not getting on those boys saying now wait a minute you know were not doing that no theyre theyre incessantly tormenting us you know and theyre telling us what you guys are doing
exactly but one of the things that weve been doing is weve been ignoring the press because we dont want the press to know what we are or are not doing you know and thats why we havent said anything one way or the other
all right
thats why the press doesnt have the correct story because were just
but the press
not talking to them
the press you know you all pulled them back because you know they feel that when you all come in here and and bang us all up and everything that you dont want them to get it on footage
yeah thats true
and thats in your favor i agree
okay
okay
you know
okay lets do this
see there were
look look theres one thing that binds us all here together
um hum
um hum
to barter someone elses decision to deal with the effects of what we have believed in because you all fail to understand what were believing in the constitution watch the baby please in in written form though theres many interpretations constitutional law says that we are to have religious freedom for religion but of course it has quotas to where weve got to define what religion is and is not acceptable
um hum
okay now we do condone a bible religion but then there comes in the aspect of interpretation so someones interpretation could be wrong and therefore making their religion wrong and if that religion hurts others if it confines others or binds others then definitely we have to take a stand and present it to the public so that the public which is our judicial system realistically can decide that well no this is incorrect and we have to in means deal with the person thats going contrary to to what the person is saying the scripture says you know people can screw things up and that religion is a false religion for sure
um hum
um hum
now thats when i had to stop and think now what does he know that i dont know i didnt know donny joe harvey or orville wells yet i didnt know that george was involved in coke and also in methamphetamine i didnt know those things then
um hum
so you know why the system did not well like i say this is a lot of water under a bridge
right
but it did make me look bad and the thing of it was was that the weapons that we purchased which you can look on all the yellow sheets at that time everything we had was with a yellow sheet
um hum
everything we bought was with a yellow sheet everything youll find that those things were bought locally and also in from palestine there were basic rugers you know and stuff which at that time was considered you know a rodent gun you know
um hum
of course we know that the 5 56 is also a military too
right
but anyway the thing of it is is that it gets blown out of proportion
right and i think one of the things that were talking about and what were trying to resolve here is is that everybodys either fears or concerns about what might or might not happen i i think that what your concern is your main concern is that we might attack you okay and
well if you attack us it just comes down to this
okay but were not we have no intentions of doing that
i know but it just comes down to this though you end up killing us
okay and our concern is that that
and then youll have a story the way you had it youll theres no theres no media around us
well we dont
youll say that we attacked you and this that
no our concern is that youre not going to come out and that you might commit suicide
well
um hum
you know [indiscernible] we will not be careful in answering this to you king we will not bow down to your law which goes against our gods law well the acid test came they threw those boys in the fire didnt they
um hum
but who protected them god did now were in the fire now not a real fire and like i say we believe that america is a great nation and that it like assyria or nineva of old can hear the message of jonah and it can have a chance to say hey you know this this what this guys teaching out of the book is straight out of the bible its in harmony its perfect maybe theres been a misunderstanding here
well what if we can go back and clarify our agreement so that you feel comfortable
right
let me let me talk about this with with some
no no come on
come on
look
oh henry
um hum
how many times has the federal government
im just thinking about all the past cases of where the like i say we both know what im talking about
whatever past cases ive had
but this is our case this is our case me and you are talking and
exactly exactly this is you and me
okay
and and
so youre worried about me committing suicide all right
we dont want anybody committing suicide
okay
well how cold is it in this room
i understand that
low forties
yeah
well
thats what we were working out now youre twisting up again
no im not
we will and thats exact
and i told you
thats exactly what were going to do
okay let me like i said finishing this tape is being dragged out now too so
okay
let me ill have to ill have to get with these you know especially some of these girls and talk to them
well as soon as i get my tape finished
im not you know im just asking you if you will consider doing that
okay
you know and like i say these people know the seals and they know that unless this country observes and sees then they know point blank whats going to happen according to the prophecies thats why our main burden is holding out here until we have an opportunity to state our cause you know what did nicodemus say he says did our law judge any many before the hearing were talking about the jewish law which is law of god now we know the law of man does but you know thats where me and you we kind of kind of have a little friction because i want to serve your laws where they coincide with gods laws and america does above all of the nations it does you know its the closest to gods laws basic principles of common sense you know but again there are some laws in the scriptures of truth which are the laws of prophecy you know and these laws are great laws because theyre additional to the ten commandment law such as the law of forgive them father they dont know what they do
um hum
see now thats a law you have to forgive people based on their ignorance
okay
now the next law which lets say the ten commandments is christ right
um hum
so the 11th commandment is forgive them okay so every man that that does err we have to forgive him cause they dont know what theyre doing
um hum
so then the 12th law will be into they hand i commit my spirit which means like isaiah 51 says when god says hearken to me you who seek after righteousness you who seek the lord look to the rock [indiscernible] you know god is that rock on that throne isnt he
um hum
and it says behold my people give ear to me oh my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light to the people and in that judgment that law is christ coming the seventh seal
um hum
now thats why without you knowing where these seven seals are in the bible you know you wouldnt know how to judge me
exactly
except by your law and i respect that see im willing to come out and be observed and judged by your
okay
law
okay
but if you allow me to first speak my law
okay
okay whats the preamble
thats thats where youre going to explain our agreement to the
oh okay right okay
okay
right all right
okay so ill call you back in a little bit

hello
hello
hello
this is henry whos this
just a minute steve steve who am i talking to
this is henry whos this
im orry i couldnt understand you
henry
henry
whos this
oh its rachel
hi rachel how you doing
okay
hows everybody doing in there
i guess okay
hows david
well he looks okay looks like hes
he looks okay
looks like hes sleeping
okay who is the nurse in there thats thats taking care of him
which nurse is it
yeah
i dont know
are you a nurse
no
okay is there more than one nurse in there
i think theres a few but i dont know who which one is which
uh huh well you know we have a concern and we wanted to see if we could talk to her so that
looks like shes waking up
oh okay
here
this harry
david
yeah is this harry
this is henry
henry oh sorry
how are you doing
okay
are you in pain
[gasping] oh its almost a funny question but oh wait a second let me look okay all right are the children there yet
yes they are you want to talk to them
yeah see rachel could you could you get larry is larry asleep or could you get rachel larry and
asleep
course little jamie cant talk so
um hum we want to confirm that youre going to be making that tape okay
yeah i was just trying to get some rest
yeah
to get my strength up
oh yeah
and what wed like to do is we are trying to not present this to somebody thats thats going to take it lightly but rather whom we are trying to contact as a matter of fact as we speak is the national christian broadcasting network okay
all right
okay
all right okay wheres wheres which where is that located at
theyre based out of arizona i think its in i think its in phoenix and they have
whats the subsidiary station here locally
that i dont know i know that they have several thousand radio stations throughout the country but you know
the station everybodys listening to right now is krld right
yeah but thats thats local
i know
were trying to get you something number one thats religious
exactly
thats thats serious
exactly
number two that has national exposure
okay
now the you know as you know that one of one of the concerns that i have is here you are very serious okay and some of these people are calling you i dont even want to tell you what theyre calling you okay i mean its something that you dont like okay so i thought it would be
no okay i just i got what youre saying just
okay so we want to have something that you know that youre going to be pleased with because its considered a serious religious network okay so we i mean we called this national network in arizona and we couldnt get a hold of anybody so what we did is we called our fbi office in phoenix and as we speak theyre waking up the people that are in charge of this
its not a 24 hour radio station
well im not sure about that im sure that it is
what what
i shouldnt say im sure that it is but but the people that we were trying to contact the head people werent around so
oh i see yeah
so they they sent people out to the home okay
right
and when i was talking to steve he was a little bit confused about what you wanted so
okay were going to make this tape its not going to be a long one
okay
and were going to put something together very tangible very simple very even and begin to show the difference between the way i perceive the seals and what in in difference to what weve heard the seals being presented thus far by all so called teachers and religious leaders that have been calling the radio stations
uh huh
so that way people will be able to honestly listen and read their bibles as theyre listening and see that i know what im talking about
exactly
and then theyll make a decision from what they themselves have seen and heard from their own bible and then like i say then im in your hands
okay one of the concerns that i have okay is im talking to some people some medical people and what i dont like what im hearing and what im hearing is that you know remember when we were talking earlier and you coughed okay you told me that you thought that you might be bleeding if you
yeah when i cough i bleed
okay now do you do you think that youre bleeding internally probably right
well the hole is right here next to the belly and it it hit me in the the pelvic and then it somehow traced around and went out kind of towards my back there was a hole in the back
[whispering] my god
that was bigger than the hole in the front
yeah well see
and then the

said something about their car being out of gasoline oh it is [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] oh that that little car you know it goes a long ways just on a well we she said
so what
that she talked to the girl mary but the thing of it is is that how low is how close to empty is it [unidentified_female_voice_in_background_not_discernible]
david
yes
what what weve done is weve gotten a you know 5 5 gallons worth of gasoline we got a gas tank full of
oh

okay all right thanks i appreciate that
okay

uh huh
so we could have a phone here

if he wants to stay thats his decision and if not then hell leave thats i just need to talk with someone
he decides he doesnt wanna go with you he doesnt want to come out to the airport whatll we do then
i dont see any reason why he wouldnt want to come out to the airport
maybe he thinks things are better off the way they are maybe he doesnt want to get into uh any more involvement
well hes not he wont be involved if he doesnt want to be involved ill just speak with him is all
well were asking im asking you whats going to happen if he says no are my passengers gonna be hurt
be a decision ill make in the future uh
thats sound thinking demands are simple
the food wasnt one of my demands sir it was just uh out of consideration for everyone uh needed some food the demands were number one starts with able to talk with mr <prisoner_last_name>
the matter to the satisfaction of everybody concerned [pause] is coming into the airport in a few minutes and uh would be out there but uh we also have a concern for safety of the people that that are bringing it out tell me uh what assurance i have that they wont be hurt
this is the captain and there wouldnt be any problem there [background_conversation]
ground control to 101
go ahead
uh <ht01_first_name> uh the foods in there theyre uh looking to bring it out to you they uh say its in large bags theyd just rather have the stewardess come down and pick it up and take back in if you want or bring it to you they dont like the idea of passing it through the window [pause] do you read <ht01_first_name> [pause] ground control to <ht01_first_name>
yes sir
the food is uh ready the people bringing it out dont like the idea of having to get up on a ladder to pass it through the window uh theyd prefer to have the stewardess come out for it or to uh bring it up to the stewardess at the door
be all right
did you hear me
negative on that repeat
will be just all right
10 4 ill tell em i dont know whether theyll theyll wanna come out that way or not but ill pass the word to em send a vehicle out itll pass the plane theyll pick up the food at the building there bring it back out to the plane [radio_cutting_out]

101 to <ht01_first_name> correction ground control to <ht01_first_name>
he can hear
through the window uh what about my demands
we can get along without the food [big_pause]
well sir i agree and thats more reason why you should uh speed up your processing
cooperating
well you can take one st one little step and and let <ch32_first_name> go and and uh then then sh then well move on to the next uh request that you have [radio_cutting_out]
go ahead <ht01_first_name>
i said its your step to take not mine
well i have probably just as much concern for that young girl as you do and possibly more and that is more of a reason why you should speed things up
no im not in control of the situation as far as the paperwork uh in certain circumstances you wou you know as well as i do that things can be don if the right people tell those people to do it and youre just stalling for time
okay the truck should be ready i think i see it pulling up over there now to load the food it should be out that way in a few minutes but uh theyre gonna want <ch32_first_name> to come out before they deliver it i believe
cant work that way
im not here to make a good showing
you gotta we gotta convince those people that uh [pause]
control to frontier 101 [radio_cutting_out]
the units there theyre putting the ladder up now they should be passing the food now [muffled_conversation]

demands

much time you talking about

wanna play god thats their problem
you think my heads screwed around wrong and uh can maybe say the same thing of you but like i said before this is uh bigger than both of us
this is the co pilot speaking and uh just for my own personal and the captain wed like to know uh how deep <ht01_first_name> is in right now i mean uh he hasnt broken any uh i mean what hes done is unlawful but uh you know how bad is it for him right now if he was to give it up right now

well youre gonna talk to your attorney arent you
with him
hell be here shortly and your your parents theyre much concerned and theyre theyre interested in trying to help you and working with you and your attorney wants to work with you and were willing to work with you what more could you ask for
im asking for is the demands i set down can be expected
listen i just got here and uh was up in washington d c he had to appear before a grand jury up there with another one of his clients and i was up in uh one of the northern counties up in georgia this morning myself and as soon as we found out that there was a a situation going on down here uh we both got off what we were doing and came down specifically to uh address ourselves to this now <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> had a problem in that he couldnt get a commercial flight he is coming down on a private plane and i anticipate he will be here somewhere around a quarter after five or so i cannot get him here any earlier and theres a tremendous traffic jam out there just need some time to talk to you uh if youve got any questions the reason why im here is to answer em okay
we have nothing to talk about
why dont you just explain to me uh some of the things that uh are going on on the plane about whos on there if theres anybody that you know uh why dont you just explain to me uh how long the planes been there cause i just got here and these guys havent even had a chance to uh sort of give me any briefing
been here two or three hours now and uh i set forth some demands and theyre stalling think uh talking with me is going to accomplish something
this is uh a whole new case in itself desperation i guess you could call it
uh well i could certainly understand your frustrations and i could certainly understand everything that youve been going through i could certainly understand everything thats happened so far today weve had only uh really sporatic coverage but its been some news coverage its just some tidbits of information that have come out and a lot of its just been real speculation and uh im not sure i really understand all of this while weve got some time do you mind just explaining to me exactly where the flight took off this morning and things like that
it took it took off from grand island
could you repeat that last uh statement <ht01_first_name> i had some trouble hearing it theyre you know theyre still directing some of these other planes in and out and uh things really are going pretty much as normal here uh i i couldnt hear what you said about where the point of uh departure [tape_cut_off]

thats what youre doing youre not destroying you lucky when this is over tonight and you go home you gotta say to yourself that a hundred or two hundred rounds that they shot in here they were lucky they didnt hit her and i had no idea they were gonna open up or i would she was still on the ground but if she was on a bed or a couch shed be dead thank yourself for that one
<name> how many rounds did you fire thats all im asking you
god almighty and we gonna talk in riddles now

im not gonna have a pissing contest with you you started to shoot first
come on <name> i wasnt even there so i couldnt of started it
im telling you here whether you were here or not whoevers in charge told them to open fire
ill keep her alive as long as i can

oh yeah
yeah
yeah thats the kind of father i am im a bad father
well you we are talking about her being a bad daughter
okay
but i mean she didnt shoot you
no she just tore my heart apart for the last three years and you have no idea what thats about
youre right i agree with you i wouldnt know because im not
no the reason to shoot her was because i dont wanna see i how many times have you made a statement or heard other people make a statement i would rather see you dead than that life how many
and you mean it i guess huh
well if i mean t it i would have emptied the fucking gun the whole fucking thing in her
well what are you doing now

youre taking my word for it and you ask <name> <name> if im a liar
well i dont know you know
you asked me a question i gave you an answer
yeah but thats not the answer thats not the answer
any cop that came from <place> and ask them if im a liar
okay heres what im asking you
youre waiting to find out if shes dead so you can open fire give me a break will you please
no all we want to do is know that shes alive all right
okay im telling you shes alive if you dont care tough thats all i could say
all right all right we will take your word we will take your word for it thats all i mean we gotta believe you what you said right we cant call you a liar and we dont know any different okay yor buddy <name> had some ride out here
yep
you know
i know it
now are you gonna talk to him and let him talk you into letting the girl out or what you know
you aint gonna do it you definitely aint gonna do it
okay
this guy heres been my friend for too long for me to even lie to him
okay okay as soon as he comes in well let you talk to him hes outside getting some air all right its kind of hot over here all right
well who are you now
me im <name> <name> im a detective
youre in charge there
no
whos in charge
i dont know theres a lot of bosses out here
why dont you ask the one that gave the order to fire thats not gonna get him nowhere
my daughter ive kept her alive for these hours by changing compresses and stuff like that if they wanna blow it all go ahead but theyre gonna find one of their bullets in her not mine
okay i told you theyre not gonna do it okay
well i heard that one before
okay hey <name> when you said your changing compresses is she bleeding much
no she stopped bleeding an hour or so ago when i put the compresses on her
okay and you can feel her pulse
yeah her eyes are open occasionally
how many times did you hit her just once
once in the lower back when she went to go out the door
you said im not a doctor
thats right you have no idea how bad shes hurt right
shes breathing she has a pulse and occasionally she opens her eyes
but shes also got a bullet in her
thats the best i can give you as far as the picture
okay what are you doing theyre firing a bullet has no conscience and what theyre doing is theyre sending bullets i repeat myself if i would have picked her up and put her on the bed shed be dead
okay
shed be loaded with bullets
youre contradicting yourself if they didnt want nothing to happen to her they would have not opened fire
you know and i know that was after you fired
no no no
all right im not gonna argue with you
im not either
im not getting in a pissing contest with you all right but our guys would not have fired unless they were fired on
well i give you my word i swear it on my little baby that my wife has that i did not open fire first as a matter of fact when the opened fire came i was putting a towel on my daughters head when the bullets started coming through
now <name> they wouldnt have shot from outside
they what
they wouldnt have shot from outside the house
thats where they came from outside
yeah all right they fired after you fired at them
no no no here we go again a merry go round
no we are not going again all right okay you spoke to your wife right
yep
all right when she calms down again well let you talk to her
okay
you had problems
you ask <name> how this all came to a good conlusion it was good for you people it wasnt good for me because i went to jail and the only way youre gonna do it is not this bullshit youre pulling with these fucking bullets because if one of them would have hit me i had two in my fucking hand one was ready for my daughter and one for my fucking mouth now if thats what you want if i woudld have got hit then my hands would have au <name> atically shot the two of them
well why would you shoot your daughter
im telling you what would have happened
youre right but when they started firing if i woudld have got shot then i woudld have pulled the trigger on the two of them now go ahead do it again
we are not gonna do it again okay
says you youre not in charge and you dont know who started the firing
thats true you got a point there
an autopsys gotta be performed on either her or me and if one of your bullets are in her you killed her i wounded her but you killed her you can blame it on me but whoever pulled that trigger youre gonna blame it on him too
<name> you know what time it is
i have no idea
its three thirty five okay you shot your daughter about ten minutes to twelve okay thats a long time for her to be laying there without a doctor looking at her
okay
all right
okay youre not taking her out so you keep this horseshit up and im gonna repeat myself ive gone through this negotiation horseshit three times and you people are real con artists with it youre not buying if you dont wanna do it my way so be it
whats your way wait a minute okay now
leave me alone
leave you alone just walk away from the whole thing
no no no leave me alone with the bullets and the fucking phone calls because all yous keep doing is aggravating
<name> we are not here to aggravate okay if we left you alone whats gonna happen your daughters gonna lay there and die
if i feel that she dont open her eyes within minutes or so on and so forth or i cant feel pulse i will call you
im tired of talking all right
<name> <name> just let me say one thing all right after you cant feel her pulse its too late
i know i know
all right you know that
i know that
all right
no okay
all right let me see if i can find <name> you wanna talk to him
yeah
okay dont hang up because we dont know if we are gonna get it back again all right okay heres your buddy all right you there <name>
<name>
<name> are you there

god <name> <name> this fucking lying bastards telling me he didnt know that they were gonna fire
<name> he wouldnt know because hes sitting someplace where im sitting in a house away from you a block of so away so this gentleman wouldnt know he only knows theres so man people here and people in authority and commanders like i say it is not a small department like <name> this gentleman here only knows what somebody tells him from the outside and its like running back and forth and ask this
<name> do you know me you know me for my word
yes i do
you told me on the way here that you give me your word that they gave you their word they would not open fire
thats the word i heard had from somebody here
as god is my judge and if i ever lied to you im not doing it now they opened fire
im not heartless
no and i know that you see <name> i know you and im telling this and im assuring to this man i dont even know this man im talking to
could i have killed <kids_names> and <kids_names>
you certainly could have and ive told them that
could i have killed <name>
let me expain something to you im not coming out of here im coming out dead as long as i know shes alive and as long as she looks at me every once in awhile i dont have no more time for that
no <name>
she tore me apart for nine years what shes done to me with her kids
its too late
its never <name> what
i would like to walk out that front door start firing and have them shoot at me
no <name> they wont do that
so <name> could see that this is what you allowed your kids to get to
<name> did i let her go
yes you did but thats what im saying
did i let <name> go
yes you did
and i could have said well im dead whats the difference
<name> do you think im gonna rot in this fucking new york jail with niggers and spicks and i know what the systems about i got a bad ticker ill die there i dont want that i wanna die out here
no
i dont care about living <name> dont you understand that
you remember <name> saying she was gonna stick by me
you heard the story all the way to the hospital that when we got there it changed
<name> we knew that and i think in your own heart you knew that too okay <name> you knew every friday when she set you up
you know why im stupid because i believe people
yeah well so did <kids_name> and <kids_name>
no
never and remember how they turned on me
<name> you never believed that and you and i never believed that we spoke in the jail many times after that even as far as she went with the prosecutors ofice that time with us you know that
you remember how they turned on me
well <name> what i told her is find a new guy and dont make the mistakes that you did with me dont allow your kids to destroy the love you have
<name> this would i might have when you first came if they would done it the way they said they were going to do it
<name> theyre letting me do that now

they opened fire whoever it is opened fire i didnt care about killing <name>
<name> let me tell you something i love this girl i spoiled her so rotten it aint funny
i believe that i know that
i want what i was trying to do was i was trying to put everything into <name> <name> <name> that i couldnt put into them because they
maybe you were a little too hard on her
i tried it with <name> and all i did was create a monster

its so hard because

<name> im not going through shackles and cuffs and all that garbage again

whoever was there made the reneges

yes there was because <name> was coming here guaranteeing me
yes
he was on the phone telling me that dont worry theyre not gonna shoot until i get there
right but he was on his way over he had no idea what was happening all right so you cant blame either one of us for that situation
no and i also heard it from somebody there they said there would be no firing

i know
<name> i dont want nobody to go through this i wish it was a personal thing you know i coulda resolved it you know i could have had it where everybody was here for dinner and just started shooting theres so many things i was contemplating but the only one i had any real hate for was my daughter and thats a goddamn shame when it comes to that
when somebody says fuck you im not coming home all i seen was red
now <name> thats what happens with you youre too quick but see how youve calmed down now you realize that you could still do lots of things right thats your reaction to go quick to snap quick see now i know you love that kid youre not gonna kid me yeah i know you think youre gonna kid <name> because he knows the kind of man
im not trying to kid nobody <name> im saying this from my heart
<name> i dont worry about myself ive lost interest in myself ive been treated like a fucking football for so long i dont know what end is up
thats rough you know
who was it that said this quote i want to hear it from you if you remember that far back no man should have to live like that
i dont remember i dont know
father <name> and that stayed with me all these years no man should have to live like that
the kids are all gonna have numbers across their chests
<name> if everybody ignored them and disowned them never sent them a birthday card or a dime in nine years that im the only one that did these things shouldnt you appreciate me
yes but sometimes it doesnt go sometimes people just you know they expect it you know that <name> that happens in life people just expect it its like at work they expect you to do things
from a stranger <name>
but they do sometimes they do
theres relatives that dont give havent sent a christmas card a birthday card spent a nickel

heres the part that gets me <name>
what
theyre aware of this yet they fired in this god damn house and they didnt miss a spot except where she was laying
<name> the important thing is they missed you okay
and the point is all the picture frames are on her i had to take the frames and the glass off her
nineteen seventy <name>
seventy four it was
nineteen years ago no seventy two
<name> nineteen seventy four i turned twenty nine years old it was my birthday that day
yeah but the first thing started the first started in seventy
the first time we met
yeah
well what do you think ive been with this one
<name> ive watched these fucking kids tear this place anyplace weve had apart and i rebuilt it only because of my fucking work and sweat and ive done without and out and out ive never seen a greedy selfish person
okay
i bought that fucking new car two days after i had it <name> takes it out and raps it up
what kind of new car did you buy
a seventy six <name> no <name> but to me it was brand new <name> and i put it in the driveway went to work so took it out and rapped the front
well cars could be fixed <name>
i know that
im talking about the intent and to get a ticket that i had nothing to do with to get me locked up what do you care about your father
what was the ticket for
parking in a handicapped zone and i only found it three days after she left but if i didnt find it a knock on the door for my arrest for not appearing in court
well i dont know if the system works the same way out here as it does out in <place> but you know youre notified first you know that by now
<name> i havent got the only traffic ticket i got in nine years was by the <name> remember that time
i dont know refresh my memory
when i told you about it and you said that the state picked it up and you cant
the one we went and got your license when you tried getting your license
no no
go ahead
i was coming back from <place> with my brother and his girlfriend and we crossed a double line and a state cop grabbed me i was driving and he gave me a ticket and i called you and i said to you i just got a ticket for crossing a double line three cars went ahead of me and did it but he didnt bother them he bothers me and i called you and told you and you said theres nothing you can do and i wound up paying the fine in <place> or something thats the only thing i got in nine years out
well thats good
i dont get involved with the police i dont break laws
i get stopped everytime i go home by the troopers every day every day they catch my <name> going up and down the road
yeah but the point is <name> i could be a law abiding citizen
see but i should know better
yeah
but i could be a law abiding citizen if i didnt have the tension of a home
i just seem to jump from the fire into the frying pan you try you try well you try running a place like i am with eight ten twelve people and try to give them orders and try to listen to the residents and try to do the repairs and then come home to fucking chaos
because she didnt pay for it i did you know it was my money that went in here and watched these fucking kids destroy not her it was me that kept this roof when i should have run a long time ago
<name> you didnt
i know it
it did me no good she would not turn against she always lied for them cheated for them and so on and stuck up for them
every mother sticks up for her kids more than a father does a fathers more of a disciplinarian than the mother
i was not allowed to discipline them thats why they went where they went thats why theyre all fucking distbags drugs and burgulars are what have you
its not <name> fault though im sure she dont want her children that why <name>
but she helped <name> she helped by covering it up not telling and so on and so forth
any of these things she covered up they wound up with the probation department coming here the police department coming here warrants for arrest how could you cover these things up they came out sooner or later
the way youre talking you should know every one of them they all came by your house
for <name> and <name> ask them the names <name> or <name> <name> ask them <name>
all right <name> do you know this <name> do you know his step children <name> i didnt even know that last name
thats her last name
no see the fellas that are here with me are you from this precinct or whatever they have here no theyre not okay the gentlemen here the negotiators here are not from apparently this
tell them to pull the records
because ive never lied to the guy he knew what pressures i was under in <place> when i lived in <place> i used to be charge of one of the biggest trucking outfits in the country not a thief or a bum i worked all my god damn life all right fault is that ive had too many marriages too many breakups and so on ive had too many disappointments and as long as ive known <name> he knew he could always trust me and as long as ive always cherished thats why i called him up today i didnt care him to get involved i called him to thank him for his friends all these years
my wife should have been concerned about me nine years ago when she allowed these fucking little bastards to steal rob tear this house apart shit all over me where i couldnt put my fucking hand on them and now the monsters have been made
it dont get easy
no it dont get any easier when they get older it gets harder
it might be easy for you because theyre you flesh and blood the only one here thats my flesh and blood is <name> is <name> the the other fucking bastards spit in my face when i keep a roof over their head i owe the nothing but i keep giving im sixty years old i go to work im a carpenter a plumber an electrician a payroll a delivery everything at sixty years old with a bad ticker just to keep the roof over the head of these bastards that come in and out when they feel like it
<name> but how about your wife shes out here shes talking to the guys from <name> here shes all upset <name> going out to talk to her
im gonna tell you this the way they did it with the bullets thats not gonna solve nothing
no they know that
its not gonna solve a fucking thing if they believe that they watch too many movies
they know they made a mistake all right

whats that
why did you lock all the doors but leave the front door open
i didnt lock any of the doors i got home from work and my parents have locked the house

and why should i stick with anything that i do
i dont now
you dont know and no one else can help me with that im just having problems in everything that i do

yeah
okay hey man look i got a list here and what ive done is put down all these things that that you all wanna negotiate about and im trying to put them in your priorities in other words number one would be the thing thats most important to you
yeah
and all down the line so that the last one is the one thats least important
yeah
okay
yeah
so let me just run down these does somebody have a pen that they could provide
i have pen paper right here
okay okay the first one is repercussions
yeah
you dont wanna be hassled because of this incident
yeah check
okay thats number one on your list two two is is solitary and confinement
yeah
how how its arbitrary and and there there doesnt seem to be any kind of rule as to who gets put in solitary or who doesnt
yeah yeah
three is better public defenders who come up here no worry about your case and actually
thats what we really need
pardon me
that thats what we really need
well that should beif that should be more higher than solitary confinement maybe that should be two i dont know
yeah
well i mean you all gotta decide on that see ive got down here thats the second most important thing after repercussion is solitary confinement
solitary confinement
yeah
the the list right there said it number two
okay then lawyers is three
okay
four is food and commissary
yeah
and thats the fact that you all get too much rice and the food is often cold before you get it
yeah
and the commissary raises their prices is trying to gouge you all
yeah
because they they have a captive market
right
and you want the prices to go down
right
the fifth thing is medical
yeah
and thats the lack of attention and a lack of concern by the nurse
right
the sixth is sanitation the roaches
yeah
the fact that blankets arent clean
yeah
and what this the toilets dont work sometimes and things like that
water dont work in half the sinks
it doesnt
yeah
okay do you have problems with the ah the toilet backing up in the sinks sometimes

sanitation i got that there the showers fungus in the showers toilet stopped up broken too toilets is always stopped up blankets not washed cloths not washed for three weeks sometimes roaches they dont spray enough
yeah
and they should spray at the top of the cell as well as at the bottom
yeah
anything else alright the next thing on the list number seven is tvs and radios
right
and thats lets see thats bulkhead one is only allowed one tv and one radio and it creates a lot of problems
for real yeah
what station well watch
yeah
cell block two has a whole bunch of tvs
its more like a favoritism thing
right they earned those privileges
yeah
saying thats on there for earning them
thats right the whole jailhouse gets more than cell block one
uh huh
who dont need no rights at all you know
uh huh uh huh
you know you know and that aint true at all you know
okay the next thing on the list number eight is better treatment

okay okay i iil ill buy that it sounds a little phony to me but ill buy it
why does it sound phony to you
well it just does
well do you know the area well enough to know where these four wheel drive things are
well i know the area well enough to know where you say they are
yeah
you know they could be across the street
but we can still well do you see one look out the window do you see one
no no no i dont see im well we can go like this for another half hour
yeah but i havent what im saying is i havent at all kidded you at all now hows hows your hostage hand holding on
well shes getting a little skitterish
yeah well i dont blame her
i dont blame her either
as a hostage
yeah
female hostage
no we dont have any female agents in this area
the answer to that is no
well it was worth a try
i know how expendable you people
yeah now what are you gonna what are you gonna do if we give you an automobile
you give me an automobile right
alright keep talking
and i drive out with her
alright
now once i have ascertained that i am not being followed that i am not being pursued i will let her go
now what you gonna do i walk out there with a gun open fire and kill her too
now you know that we are not gonna do that
thats a god damn lie and you know it and i know it too
i didnt say thats what we are gonna do
i know it too
well lets put it like this
so at this point now where are you gonna release the hostage if you detect an automobile you think is a police car got there are a lot of cars out there its getting up to the quitting time you know for businesses there gonna be a lot of traffic out there are you gonna be able to tell one from the other or are you gonna stay scared that it might be a police car following you forever
no im not gonna be afraid of that i know
because your it could be any car you know thats a police car
what do you mean by safely out of the area how far you gonna have to get away
i dont know ill determine that when i find out but you know its not gonna be new york
again as i say if you see any any car youre gonna think its a police car
no im not no im not but i am gonna be very very careful just as i want you people to be
we are being very very careful
hold on a moment please has her family been notified
yes
yes what about the kids
i dont think they know
they dont know
but i i know that i know that her husband knows but i dont think that the children have been told unless theyve seen it its bound to have been on local television by now
oh im sure it has been
i wanna resolve it but man i dont wanna pitch tent here in this office and stay here for eternity
no
well thats true okay
no she looked fine except that she is very very scared
yes she is and i dont blame her
yeah well neither do
wish theres something i her besides letting her go because i would do it
as a matter of fact i think shes i think shes held up real well
i think she has too
i cant
if i took somebody else right if i took one of you people for instance
alright
you peopled always be an the lookout do something to me
thats right
and i cant take a shot i cant take a chance at that really cant
well
then i really might be forced to hurt somebody
no no no
and i think thats the way out of it
yeah
become a permanent resident of some federal penitentiary someplace well i aint gonna do that
well i wont know anything about
no i like i said i dont wanna have to hurt her
i know you dont
i really dont i think she believes that i really dont wanna hurt her but if you people wanna force me to if you force my hand
i told you we are not gonna force you to do anything we havent yet weve agreed to everything that youve demanded
yeah
and you people can do with me what you please
yeah i know i know i know weve gone through this before
i know like i said weve gone through this before and everything we bring it up we are just wasting time
okay the best deal i got going for me is for you to bring that car around to the front and i will tell you precisely
what do you mean his radio youre risking its the girls life youre risking
yeah i know it but hes gonnna have to hes not even here right at the moment ill have to get a unit let me call you give me ten minutes and then ill then well make arrangements for bringing this car over

yeah theres no point in playing stupid either and youre playing stupid you wanna play stupid ball i can play stupid ball
now whats whats gonna happen when you get outta there with that girl
we are gonna drive away
youve got all kinds of youve got all kinds of automobiles youve got all kinds of people citizens who have a chance of getting killed
now ive told you before <name> that theres you you its a pipe dream to think youre gonna get out of there without some kind of of surveillance
you let me hang onto my pipe dream
of some kind of somebody following you
well fine
if any policeman out there wants to take a shot at me and kill the girl at the same time thats fine
i know enough about human nature i also know that you people give orders and you people take em and i also know that if an order is issued that fire anything at me while ive got the girl in my custody then i know that that is what is gonna happen as well as you do
yeah
now you want everyone phoning sight down on me
im not trying to run anything on you really and truely im not
okay i told you i want a car at the only at the that is non negotiable now if you think im gonna walk out of this son of a bitch youre insane now the car is non negotiable you understand that
what do you mean by non what do you mean you just youre not gonna negotiate any further if we dont give you an automobile
precisely if you want to park a boeing seven four seven in the parking lot ill consider that
yeah you have no other alternative plans right
nope and i am not gonna give myself up now if you people wanna call in the army and storm this god damn place youre perfectly free to do that too
now you know we are not gonna do that dont you
im a rational sane human being who can commit irrational insane acts when pushed to the point of doing it
well im not
you people insist upon pushing me to the point of doing something that everybody is going to regret then i will do it
well i dont want you to do that
i dont wanna do it either now if you people want to very callolisly very carelessly throw this girls life away
thats the last
youve got no choice neither do i
well you youve you leave us no place to go
you gotta give me the car
and ive got whoa whoa
go ahead
since youre dumb let me run it by you one more time
alright

okay as long as <name> understands and the <name> okay
okay theres not much answer i can give you to that i know that you dont wanna do that
no i dont blitz i will if you force me to
look you get me the car

but i will
give me a give me an alternate give me something else that i can present to them
like what
i dont know give me im running out of ideas give me something to talk to them about
alright you run a few ideas up the flagpole you go right ahead im all ears
well im trying to think of some im trying to think of some ideas you wont swap you wont let that girl go and take one of us youve told me that already
yeah
either me or anybody else right now youve already told me that that you wont do that
youre expendable
sure im expendable
im not and neither is the girl
well whats gonna happen when you walk out of there dont you think youre gonna become expendable
not as long as ive got her
well how about when you when you let her go
well thats something well take care of when it happens in the mean time keep running some ideas by me
but you ar you are absolutely expendable as soon as you walk out of that bank as soon as you expose yourself
not as long as ive got the girl
no way you can guarantee her safety
if i dont get the car you know what im gonna do
well you dont know that do you
you dont wanna just take a life
yeah but you dont know that
well no i dont im guessing just by talking to you pardon
i mean youre really pushing me
no im trying not to push you
no
trying to think of some alternatives
now i know that you can have a car out there in thirty seconds if you wanted to
well we can have a car out in four or five minutes you made us pull all the units back and thats one of them its back wed have to get to it youd have to give us some idea what you want us to do with it if we decide to give you an automobile
no im not gonna let you do that
yeah
you people playing ball with me and both of us are gonna live too
now i have been playing ball with you i think
and you continue you continue
the only way that you are gonna do that is meet my demand for an automobile
under what terms
yeah but as soon as i walk out with you theyre gonna start firing
okay well i am gonna once again veto a swap okay once we get in that car and drive away that you have lost all control of the situation also it is also true equally true that you dont have any control over the situation now
well no we dont thats true and that as long as youre in there and we are out here then weve got more control than we have if youre out riding around in a automobile weve got more control
oh yeah well i grant you that i grant you that however now if you want to play around with this girls life you go right ahead
by god thats the last thing i want to do ive told you that several times today thats the last thing i want to do is
i suggest that you get on the stick and you get me a car
the last thing i want to do is to is to play around with your life its your life too you know youve thought about that
well lets forget about that for the time talk about the girls life
well i dont figure that i got much to live for so

what
she said yeah
what about your temperature
we didnt we didnt check my temperature its pretty chilly here though i dont i dont
okay
yeah
what about your color skin color

i dont look pale or anything
no
can you see its kind of dark in here oh dont make me laugh lets see well i you know like i say she didnt tell me that you know what my skin color looks like
okay
i look at my arm it dont look too bad
okay and and your breathing is normal
well i mean well i cant take very deep breaths because
okay
you know it gets down into the area that kind of very sensitive
okay
okay so okay now matter of fact i was recording when the phone rang so i have to back up a bit and kind of delete that out also i had you know a couple or three babies crying i had to re edit over that too
okay
so you know its dont want to get too much i dont want to get that in the tape
okay
okay
you mentioned that its a little bit colder that youre a little bit cold
well all our windows are gone right now
oh okay but you dont feel like your like your skin is clammy or anything like that
no its im under ive got about about three or four blankets on me
oh okay
from my basically from my chest down and plus i got that big sheet tied in a knot and you know around the wounded areas
okay
so
okay
what what happened
no i was clearing my throat
that was a was a gunshot what [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible]
no i was
oh something dropped okay
oh okay we want to ensure you know that that you get what what we say that that youre going to get and that we get what what you say were going to get so
right
could we have you dictate or or just give us a preamble indicating what you hope is going to happen with the tape and and then say that
well i can put that on the tape too if you want
okay and then
okay and that way everybody hear it
everybody comes out
right
okay now
but youre going to like i say when when you bring the guys up here remember i know i know theyre paramedics i know theyre really good but like i say i i dont i havent taken no no alcohol no drugs no aspirin nothing you know i dont i dont really believe in that unless its extreme emergency and and its just this state that im in right now under the conditions i havent taken any of those things
okay
so i mean ive been sitting in this one position and its everything i i can do just to to like every once in a while i got to like just move my legs like an inch this way inch that way my my toe bone is like [groaning] i i cant describe it its its like its numb
now are you perspiring
no im not perspiring
okay
no because its like i say rita how cold do you think it is right now [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible]
see one of the things is if with all the blankets that you have you should be perspiring a little bit under the blankets you know
well no i i as far as the blankets are concerned its i just i feel warm
okay
and im not perspiring
okay
and besides my from my around my waist and my my rear end and my tailbone all thats its basically numb except for the pain of trying to move and then you know the guts kind of numb
um hum
except if i try to make any immediate moves
um hum
so you know its just now as far as my hands and all that i can feel that theyre cold i have the wound on my left hand which the bullet you know kind of chopped me in the left of my wrist
um hum
and my thumb is dead you know its just like it dont its not there
uh huh
of course im looking now i i let the bullet just took a clean just a real clean gash right out of it you know just like its weird just just passed right just took skin and its neat and everything just right out so i i just left it kind of open you know and it didnt
um hum
and it bled for a long time my my whole left side of my shirts all blooded but it finally stopped bleeding then it
um hum
its just like a big old crevice there you know
oh yeah this this truth is everything i mean
okay
like i say when you hear this tape youll realize that
how how much of the tape do you have going
oh weve got weve got more than half of it
okay
like i said ive had first of all we had trouble getting the tape machine going you know how it is and then ive im trying to keep the thing right up to my mouth
um hum
we had to were using a high bias tape but we had to go down to like a more of a mid range compact panasonic
okay
which the heads are good heads on it you know it still it can be quite legible for you know a radio
okay
of course they can also mix it too
yeah let me back up here
sounds a little higher than what my voice is but
okay
this is a small speaker can you hear that [playing_following_from_tape] last living disciples on the isle of patmos being a prisoner for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ which no doubt are the things jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the pharisees and sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on a lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia which we do see clearly in the scriptures
david
yeah
that sounds pretty good
like i say its the the way you know if youll hear between it kind of breaths and pushes
um hum
and i tried to make that you know like i say i tried to make it as clear as possible
okay
so you know thats thats why i was you know but what i did was is if we got a couple of the guys and they kind of they kind of pulled me up a bit we put the what do you call this cushion scott
its a foam [indiscernible]
a foam yeah to where i could kind of sit up a little bit and im kind of about at a 45 degree i dont know any anyway so i just like tried to take a short breath and just belt it out as best i can

okay
i just want you to see that theyre not bearing any arms
okay
and like i say they can go out that way because some like have two children some have three children
okay
you know and then you know ill space them at a long enough distance to where and you can see theres a steady line of them and
okay
ill have them walk up to the to the front of the property there at the gate then the guys will come out and ill have them hold their hands up
okay and single file
and okay like yeah single file not two at a time
um hum
their hands up and and well do you have like
we can turn
warm vehicles and stuff like that
what well do is well well turn on the lights and they can walk towards the lights and then well have people you know ready to to assist them once they get to to the cars
all right now whens this now whens this tape going to be played again
like i said lets still do the children thing
okay
well we
i do
we want to play it as soon as we can so we can get everybody out
well we
so people can hear it
we can do that and absolutely we will do that
okay then all right then but we
but we want but we want we want to start getting this thing you know we want to try to bring this
im aware i realize
im not no
no i want this to i want
if we take a look at the record of john the gospel writer john take chapter 7 we see in scripture john writes that after certain events after these things jesus walked in galilee he would not walk openly he would not walk in jewry would not walk amongst the jews because the jews sought to kill him we might wonder why wasnt christ such a good man now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that they disciples also may see the works that thou doest for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if though do these things shew thyself to the world for neither did his brethren believe in him strange statement isnt it its funny how that when men live and have to deal with realities of life that even a man like christ could have to meet with unbelief even from his own brethren then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is always ready and im sure most fellow bible students will agree the time referred to is the time of his crucifixion they wanted to kill him and he didnt want to show himself openly then jesus said to unto them excuse me verse 7 the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret you would wonder why a man like christ would have something to hide i mean surely the angels would protect him obviously i personally think a lot of things about this strange character and disposition of character but were sure in being christian that christ knew what he was doing [unidentified_voices_in_background_not_discernible] then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he
well can you let them find out if they see the stretcher if they took the stretcher out
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people
the truck is here but were waiting to see if they let out the stretcher are you there
yeah
okay
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
what did you say about the stretcher
now we understand the jews at that time had their own religious [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible]
oh
political network didnt they
okay well were sending it
and a pretty strongly religious spectrum although they had no actual political power they were subject to the relevant government and thus to the really traditional rabbinical laws now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught and jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned now in the days of israel most scholars and teachers will agree that the schools of israel ordained by the sanhedrin and also the pharisees were schools similar to the ones of our own theological schools of today of which a careful student of scripture observes that no where is it written in the gospel that christ ever attended these schools but at the age of 12 he did enter into the temple and had a most unique and interesting discussion with the religious leaders of which they were quite amazed at such a young lads knowledge of scripture now this man was teaching something no doubt christ that is that inspired the people to say you know how knoweth this man you know letters having never learned they marvelled jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me now what does that mean my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me
returning to [indiscernible]
if any man will do the will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself now friends people that love the lord this is where we begin to talk about some serious things im sure youre all aware of how how im involved in a very serious thing right now and im sure that a lot of you realize that i should be possibly scared concerned there is women children and men involved in our situation here at mt carmel but i am really concerned about the lies of my brethren here and also really concerned even greater about the lies of all those in this world you know without christ without jesus we have no hope why well because we know that the standard of gods righteousness is a law a law between men a law of statutes and judgments and which god gave unto moses from sinai say this is thy righteousness o israel but you know god also gave another law a law revolving around a system of shedding a poor and innocent lambs blood and that all who would break the law of god who would seek [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]
well the the truck is there and its like in front of the driveway of our neighbors house but we cannot see any stretcher anywhere
okay the truck is there but you cant see the stretcher

okay thanks
okay
okay bye bye
okay
rachel
yes
okay is david still listening to the message
yes
okay all right just hang on here with me
okay
for they know not what they do [indiscernible] which is a point that were fixing to get into quite heavily father into thy hands i commit my spirit taken from psalms 31 we begin to see that christ is well versed at the scripture just like the gospels tell him when [indiscernible] always referring i guess to temptation by stating it is written it is written it is written now what is this spirit of christ well they pierced his side out of his side came blood and water i get another mystery this became something to do with eating his body and drinking his blood some implements for the church but what do these things really mean well after weve read acts and learned of the power of pentecost the cloven tongues of fire that came upon the apostles who by mercy through christ were given another chance to recover from their falling we learn through romans that there is a righteousness of god in christ declare his righteousness we learn in corinthians i and ii we learn in ephesians galatians philippians oh we have such a wealth of information of such intelligent men who speak sometimes very deep mystical things about a god who is in the form of humanity who is the son of god who sits at the right hand of god in the highest court of the universe
keep the kids quiet
who promises that one day hell come again well the last living apostle [indiscernible] this great controversy and i might add those who persecuted christ who would not hear him no matter what sign was given also persecuted his disciples and finally we end up in the book of revelation where john the last living disciple on the isle of patmos being a prisoner for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ which no doubt are the things jesus has to say which would probably be quite controversial to the things that the pharisees and sanhedrin of the day had to say were sure he being on this isle of patmos a prisoner on the lords day had a vision and it states in this vision we should all be familiar with it hopefully or get familiar with it he has a messenger the angel of the lord come to him who identifies himself as the spirit and he is told to write the seven churches of asia of which we can see clearly in the scriptures that they were given specific and direct messages from christ and in each one of these messages christ specifically told the churches what he would have them to do now we know that christ is the only man in scripture who ever kept the law of god perfectly we know that because weve heard the writings of the apostles but sad to say the religious leaders of his days and the majority of the populace of his days didnt think so its funny how that is its kind of like people always like to build the sepulchers of the dead prophets and garnish their tombs but yet they hate and kill the living prophets only god knows why that is but nonetheless the church of ephesus smyrna thyatira sardis philadelphia laodicea the churches thats involved for anyone to read direct counsel is given beginning with its the age of the church of ephesus right these things [indiscernible] what happens if the best is given and then the decision is up to those [indiscernible] christ each council [indiscernible] even has ear to hear so if you want to know but in here with the spirit [indiscernible] the church finally we get to the 40th chapter of revelation
they picked up the stretcher now theyre on their way back
and as soon as scripture becomes [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]
they picked it up you said
yeah
and theyre on
now theyre on their way back
okay okay good can you see them
yeah
which was referring to the last part of third chapter of the message of laodicea he says after these things i saw and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice that spake to me as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you that which must be hereafter now the question to every true christian is this is john telling us the truth or is john lying to us we know he just gave counsel to the seven churches of asia which were alive and hopefully in good health when he first gave these letters to them but nonetheless they being of asia are know wise the same people of us today or even of the oncoming years thereafter so the events of chapter 4 clearly explained by john that his messenger as sent to him stated that he be taken up hither therefore a door opened in heaven the bible records and he was to be shown things which must be hereafter sometime after johns day now what did he behold in chapter 4 of revelations he says that he was in the spirit he immediately was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and he states that the throne was occupied someone sat on the throne and he that sat upon the throne was like a jasper a sardine stone i [indiscernible] say the scripture knows all the way through prophecy all the way through the bible as far as back as the days of genesis even to the prophecy of deuteronomy 32 where it says god is a rock he is our rock and his work is done in truth and in righteousness all the prophets refer to god as a rock now here we see in revelation john likewise written it says god has the appearance of a jasper and a sardine stone [indiscernible] there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like an emerald he carefully saw that there were living creatures around the throne saying that god is holy holy holy which was is and is to come god intended all things for which the pleasure they were and are created now this instruction emphasizes that there is a god a kingdom a judiciary in the respect that john witnesses that there were 24 elders sitting on 24 thrones seems to imply a judgment but uniquely enough in this judgment or in this throne or in this heavenly sanctuary as we see from the rise and fall of the apostles paul only talks about the heavenly sanctuary the heavenly sign in this sanctuary we see a god a rainbow a throne living creatures stating that god is holy which was is and come the past present and future and that this god this creator of all things is holy and deserves to be worshipped we continue on in chapter 5 to see that i beheld john says the right [indiscernible] that sat on the throne a book or a scroll sealed with seven seals notice its written on the inside and the backside well the meaning of these things kind of will be speculated until we have solid proof in other words unless we were there ourselves to see it in detail but what we are allowed to see in the scripture is john also beholds a might angel in this throne room where all these angels thousands ten thousand and thousands and thousands are called together and this mighty angel questions all in heaven who is worthy to open this book and to loose the seven seals thereof clearly scripture states no man in heaven neither on earth neither under the earth of course buried in other words we do have dead in this world you know was worthy to open neither to look thereon so hey god says in scripture at least john testifies in scripture that the mystery of god his book is sealed well what happens is as we continue on we see in chapter 5 that john begins to weep until one of the elders says weep not john behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof of which we know the lamb being a symbol of christ is brought to view and john beheld a lamb as it had been slain in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and the elders with seven eyes and seven horns well whats the meaning of these things
theyre back
if god does have a revelation [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]
rachel
yes they made it back
they made it back
um hum
okay super lets see we still got a half hour on that tape
um hum
is weve got to move the buses okay
um hum just a minute let me see if he wants to talk to you

david do you want to talk to him because he wants to talk about moving the buses
theyre going to come up
hello jim
steve

just so nobody shoots them
right
okay okay
right
okay
now is david going to lead you out
were going to carry him out
youre going to carry him out but with with
it will probably take a few people to do it because you know he weighs a little bit here
yeah yeah about four you know and
yeah
get a group together and
yeah thats probably true thats probably best
and and anybody who is hold on a second
okay
steve
yes
i got the commanders calling me
okay

scott is david there
yes he is
may i speak to him please

yes
okay hold on
thank you scott
david its henry [unidentified_male_voices_in_background_not_discernible]
were going to let you speak to the nurse first okay
oh okay good
hello
hello
hello
hello
youd like to know mr koreshs feelings his condition
yes
well his blood pressure is to 85 over 40 his pulse is 60 just a little irregular
um hum
and his temperature is normal his color hes drinking all right hes passing water all right and his condition is just stable
okay now is he bleeding a lot is he losing a lot of blood
well he was losing a lot but now it has subsided
okay
yes only when when on movements
okay do you know if any of the major blood vessels were taken out
no it doesnt seem likely
okay how about any vital organs
it doesnt seem as any vital organs have been damaged
well just a minute please david
david
david i highly recommend medical attention what [indiscernible] what would i say hes asking me whether you need medical attention [unidentified_male_voices_in_background_not_discernible] yeah well at the moment we dont think its necessary
okay what time exactly did you take the the blood pressure
ive only just taken it about 3 minutes ago
okay and what is your name
my name is jillian matthew
okay jillian if you would see 85 over 40 is a little bit you know is a little bit of a concern so i would like for you to take it like maybe in another half hour or so
um hum all right
okay
yes
okay may i speak to him
all right you like to speak to you
yeah
youre holding up huh
yeah but she said it was a miracle
yeah yeah
i got to like i said you know you got a got a strong will you got a strong will
um hum well thats real good were happy to hear that i have a bit of a concern
uh huh
now wait a minute now youre making a statement youre making a statement which is totally contrary to everything those children with reasoning powers have been taught scripturally youre denying what they themselves have sit and heard day by day so i know point blank that you know you have not asked them in regards to whether theyre going to see their parents again because the whole doctrine revolves around you know isaiah 49 where it says i will save thy children referring to the covenants and you know they they know all of these or at least are aware in conversational wise children that age usually do not have a conscience to discern or understand you know the high points of doctrine or philosophy but no the thing of it is that you know every one of these mothers tell them well ill see you soon so i dont know why youre saying that henry
well im not im not questioning you know your word you know i just
well i mean how you know by by your statement it implies that youre just making a statement but the question lies is did you really ask them
well see for example one of the kids you know came out with a note that says that that his name is joshua and that hes 7 years old and you know it lists all the different people that you know i guess are relatives of
relatives correct
okay
and weve and we asked we asked jim originally we said look jim because we first of all our children dont eat pork
okay
okay now whether you all uphold that or not we we cannot really guarantee that but come to find out instead of calling the because i understand it may take a day or two in some cases but instead of calling the present closest relative you all you all have gone ahead and put them down at the social place
um hum um hum
you know and which you know like i say thats kind of really neither here nor there at this point in time you know ive trusted jim i i would think that he would be smart enough not to consider these children you know worthy of a foster home or something like that because that would strictly violate the reasons why that you know most of these women and stuff would be coming out in the first place
okay
i mean they dont want to be judged or considered that theyre unworthy of motherhood
um hum
or you know having their children you know because of an incident such as were in at the present time
uh huh
i mean thats another thing of trust again because like i say maybe thats what youre going to do maybe thats not what youre going to do you know we dont know as of yet like i say you know in my case i realize that you know ill ill never see my children again you know because you know i understand through through many many observations and through much history research you know how the government works and stuff like i say i will dance to the music that i i have played to you see what im saying
um hum
okay but the main thing is for me to stand up in front of my father my god and to present a truth that he gave to me because theres one reality thats above all realities and that is when the powers that control the universe you know when those other worlds and those other beings out way beyond when they come and communicate to you you know
um hum
a lot of people have a very elizabethan ideal of god you understand
um hum
they think gods got a beard and wears a robe and and not a very smart you know its kind of old you know traditional old english or you know god is very high tech gods got computer systems and technology above and beyond what this worlds ever seen
um hum
i know harry you see
um hum
in 1985 like i said i had a little visit when i was in israel ive always been a sincere guy like randy will tell you you know if you ever interview randy he knows i used to always tell him as a kid that you know theres got to be a god and all my life ive ive had this calling this you know these anyway but never mind but the thing comes down to this theres a test in latter days and its a test of human intelligence and all that which is human that is not going to use its intelligence i dont mean in regards to bureaucratic law
um hum
you see remember that two individuals that are into bureaucratic control
um hum
can cause millions of people to go to war
um hum
a hothead like hussein and a hothead like oh my mind lets see here the cuban guy castro
uh huh
see just their their one decision can cause many men to go and lose their lives right
right
well see you might call that a political thing
um hum
but it really its its politics is another form of religion
um hum
you see it denies a deity a sovereignty but still it has its principles
um hum
its philosophies and its well not theology its i guess humanology [sic] its utopianistic views
um hum
okay so the point that we finally come around to is this if you were in israel and you was confronted with you know something from beyond this world something that you know confronted you and communicated with you and told you what you must do and showed you things such as you have never dreamed see i used to stutter all my life i was a stutterer
um hum
i stammer all through school had a speech problem you know
uh huh
but after that event i never stuttered again
uh huh
but like i say we have to we have to realize that that in todays world with such modern technology everywhere we we have to look at old truths of the bible
um hum
in a modern way
um hum
and the modern way is is computerized technology seven seals what is it you know data program in other words what mind of man can be able to categorize all the testaments of the prophets and put it together into seven categories see now thats technology
uh huh
and the thing of it is its called wisdom
um hum
and scripture teaches us that if we fail to be interested in this riddle then the worlds that are beyond our world are going to destroy all those whose attitude have shown that they have not chosen to increase and grow in wisdom
um hum
see the prophecies themselves may be allegorical
um hum
they may be just little stories but nonetheless it still is a test
um hum
you know when youre when youre a little kid and they send you to a psychiatrist dont they put tell you to put these little blocks in this little block thing there and you got to shape up match up the sizes
right
okay well the same as this last revelation we have such pious and powerful men in the world such power look at the pontiff
um hum
you notice how powerful that religious man is
um hum
i mean no one questions the the history and origin of the papacy
um hum
i mean it killed millions the jesuit priesthood for those who went against its infallible laws the eucharist the catechism all the all the thousands and thousands of newborn babes they found in the catacombs you know and under the the chapels and stuff that they put in the lime pits of course we always thought that the virgin and the priest never did anything right
um hum
yeah but we find out later that there evil things were being done under a cloak
um hum
and martin luther rose up against it and how did he overthrow that system with truth
um hum
a bible truth
um hum
so today we we have a truth a bible truth but its not going to overthrow just the papacy
um hum
its going to you know bring all the world into a valley of decision people are going to have to hear it theyre going to have to say to themselves well you know thats right that is right that is exactly what is being said in harmony and that that does agree
um hum
then theyre going to wonder well i wonder who this guy really is
um hum
well the thing of it is is that im going to let you in on a secret about christ okay
okay
anyone that god chooses to place his power and spirit in no matter to what degree that spirit is all have the same spirit of the one and only living god
um hum
so what im saying is im saying that the spirit of elijah is no more different than the spirit of moses or the spirit of daniel or the spirit of hosea because these men as men can do nothing of themselves because all of these prophets had the spirits of christ
um hum
so christ did not come in person except he came in the person of his messengers
um hum
and the power of heaven strengthened these men and enlightened these men and gave these men gifts of knowledge and understanding to speak in behalf of christ
um hum
which is the true living god the word of god otherwise you know you cant put 2 ounces of faith in man its impossible
um hum
so anyway
okay
okay let me get back to this tape and what was what was the question again you was wanting you was wanting to know something else
well one of the things that that we have a concern about of course is the kids were hoping and were were certain that we want them to be reunited with their families we can count on that
yeah well we realize also and i was discussing it with some of the people here that that you know once we go out theres going to be you know now we realize our butts are in trouble there is some extensive research that has to be done you know someone is responsible for the deceasement [sic] of law enforcement officers
um hum
you know im im hopefully they say on the news that it shows clearly in regards to when the officers first approached it shows you know who fired first because i was standing right there in the door and i know you know that no fire came from our side first
okay
you see but the thing of it is is that my only hope would be for that is that is that those those cameras actually were zooming in enough on that front door
um hum
to show just exactly of course what i heard one guy comment was is that you know somebody saw somebody there with a firearm and so once they saw the firearm that thats a sign to go after it right
um hum
isnt that isnt that a atf rule or law i mean if if you all walked into a place and a guys standing there with a gun you know i mean thats thats what you got to do you got to draw out right
well
so thats probably where our problem came from
um hum
but you know i had my head and part of my body sticking out that door i was actually standing in the door there and i i waved out and thats probably all on film too and says you know get out of here theres women and children lets talk lets go get out you know so
um hum
you know i hope they
well one of the things that concerned us was that one of the mothers said to one of the kids ill see you on the other side so you know we were we just wanted to make sure
um hum
you see im i respect that very much i i appreciate that you know i thank god for that that you know under the circumstances that you have borne with me
um hum
you know so this gives the confidence you know because this is a great nation america and it should be you know more considerate and more intelligent in regards to these things
um hum
okay so now this gives me more liberty to entrust myself in the hands of this system you know for you guys to be able to help drive this situation out of the mud you know this is like a four wheeling truck and were all in it and were stuck you know and we all have to drive this thing out
okay
and thats what im saying im saying if you guys play right were going to play right
okay
i do not believe that how this got started was right but i was not going to you know allow after all the things have been said about me allow myself to just stand back and sit back and allow the system to come in and you know push push me around i cant do that
um hum
you see i cannot have the message of truth to be stifled that that easy
um hum
but you know you guys you and jim have been very very considerate very kind not at all like you know the aftermath of theres theres a batf video out on you guys its called breaking the law in the name of the law
um hum
im sure youve seen that of course like i say you know its its not meant to ultimately degradate you but its it just simply shows that people are human okay
um hum
on both sides so anyway i guess ive said enough and no you you tell the children that you know weve been letting them out little by little to see what you alls reaction was going to be because theyve been saying on the radio all the time that you all are fixing to hit us tonight you know
well no we
and jims been telling me thats not true
weve never had that plan you know we
so ive ive been balancing it out on both sides
okay
because like i say i have to stand in a position to where if you do hit us tonight
no
youre going to youre going to be guilty of killing little children
exactly
and the thing of it is is that thats why in the beginning i made it very plain i stood in the door there you know and thats not very fun with a bunch of professionals you know coming at you and i tried to tell them holler best i can lets talk about this i tried to talk to robert gonzales first you know
um hum
and you know i saw him on news here but i think its very cheesy in his behalf very very cowardish [sic] to be staying out of the light now because he could have and you tell him this he could have stopped all of this
um hum
you know his conscience is probably eating him up
um hum
so anyway
okay
okay im sorry so
well thats what we want
oh im im still here
no i dont think anyones going to commit suicide
nobodys going to be coming out playing john wayne
okay well
i mean have i mean are we letting our children out i mean you know are the children gone do the children look like theyve been abused or neglected
no no
okay so do they act abnormal except the one child because it was born that way it was
um hum
a medical misinterpretation you know the doctor didnt quite diagnose something right
um hum um hum
and it affected the child but are you happy with the children so far
yes yes
do they look like theyre raised strange abnormal
well just like jim said that and and like i say in our past experience together weve seen its been more shadowy on your side than its been on mine
i understand
i mean ive kept just like the other night jim told me not to deal with anybody else but him and we made an
um hum
an agreement and then you know another guy came along and and then all of a sudden da da da da da you know he we we he was very forceful and very strong and when someones going to play forceful and strong to me then im going to play forceful and strong back
that makes sense
you see but if someones going to sit down and say look im willing to give you you know 50 percent of the chips and ill take 50 percent of the chips and well play this card game fair
um hum
then you know when the chips are all on your side then ill ill fold up you know its a fair game
okay
and thats thats the way thats the way ive always been its the way ive always taught the doctrine that was given to me
okay
and this is the way the truth has to be
okay one of the things that i you know that i had a concern about and you dont have to give me the specifics on this but you know when weve talked about the number of children that are within the compound weve never had a real good idea and you dont need to tell me that but i feel
well ask the children that are there you know of course like i say they dont probably know either but just ask them if theres a lot more children thats all you have to do
right
thats
youre being very courteous but when it really comes down to it youre talking to me agent to criminal thats what were talking here okay
no im not talking to you agent to criminal
no but realistically thats what it is
what im
i have violated in all appearances the codes of the united states of americas law thats why now your job is to to deal with my mind and to try in your best ability to come to some feasible conclusion of how we can settle or resolve our problems or differences now because of this situation you know i am the one in trouble youre not okay now your courtesy im being very responsive to because i realize i am in trouble and i realize what the future holds for me even when i give myself up to you you know i dont know to what degree is going on my body right now but nonetheless i dont think i have to really worry too much about that because you know when i give myself over to you i still have to keep my mind on god because you know whatever i receive from the judicial system of america you know thats what i receive
okay but
and if god doesnt deliver me out of it then thats what i get
um hum
and its to the lords great wishes
um hum
but like i say the point is this everybodys going to know the importance of the seals then arent they
exactly
thanks to you
well
and thats very commendable
and thanks to you too but i want you to i dont want you to look at me as just somebody thats looking to you as a criminal im looking to to ensure as best as i can that you and everybody thats within the compound gets out alive and that these
right
children have an opportunity and that your mission and your cause because youre so devoted to it if you tell me look this is what i want to do to guarantee all of these peoples lives then im with you ill work with you as hard as i can
right well thats what thats what i was telling jim earlier i was telling look jim ive got a plan
okay
and the first thing i told him was is this i said jim i said look ive been hit and i get ive been getting weak i says ill tell you what you let me just lay here and let me die i says and give these people time to think
um hum
because i wont influence them
right i remember that
and i says and once im dead then theyre going to be sitting around here and theyre going to be thinking you see and ill be gone there will be no more influence and that way they can make decisions on their own see thats what i was first telling jim
um hum
you know and jim says no no no of course the other option is is that if if they dont give us time for the people to make these decisions you know then its always going to stay in the light that well as long as im the leader theyre going to do what i say but thats not the way this program is operated
uh huh
thats the way it appears you know and its true on that tape i did scream and i did call some people some stupid idiots but if you do the whole story
um hum
of what somebody had done
um hum
you dont mingle this truth with people that do perverse sins
um hum
now theres a reason why somebody just like christ anyway christ called the disciples fools didnt he
um hum
not that he was hating them but because they had done some foolish things
exactly
but the point is this what i need to do now is i need to buckle down and i need to you know i had some just a little bit of chicken soup here and
okay have you had any
oh yeah i had a little bit and
okay
and i need to readjust myself here and start doing this tape
okay
ive been going through these different tape machines the the big tape machine we we have some trouble with because it uses a akg phantom powered mike
um hum
and we havent been able to find it and the guys are kind of worried about turning on the lights in the building in case you know somebody you know how it is you know
if you tell me that youre going to turn the lights on you can go ahead and turn the lights on nothings going to happen you know
yeah because
i can advise the people that the lights are going to go on because were working on something
yeah
and its not going to be a problem
well what happened was that we went ahead and we got a couple of you know of higher quality hand held cassettes and i already know
oh okay
its got a dolby on it and as long as we have the dolby then the equalization is going to be audible enough to where they can remix it at the studio and play it live
okay
you know i am a musician you know
okay
so anyway okay well then ill ill get to this then well call you or youll call me at around 6 oclock then right
probably around 5 oclock
okie doke

david
yeah
how are you doing
im getting this thing ready here weve been having some difficulty with the main board we got a toshiba and tas [phonetic_sp] cam a studio series 2416 and its its kind of like its been kind of a wild wiring process here
um hum
because you know we dont put this equipment where were at right now
okay
but anyway yeah we got we got a tape going and stuff and its im fixing to start up here
okay good i wanted to bring you up to date and what weve done is weve contacted krld
right ive been kind of halfway listening to it turned way down but
okay and as soon as we get the tape were going to have krld play it okay in addition to them the national christian broadcasting network is going to play it now the the thing that i want to tell you about that is theyre going to play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock you know more than once several times but you know thats phoenix time so were talking about 11 oclock there you know before we before we get it here but were going to give it to krld as soon as we get it and thats going to go over you know their network and im sure other people are going to start picking it up
okay let me let me see now so when when its going to first be played at krld
right
so thats local but its going to be at what time at night
no i mean if you want it played more than once well you know once they play it once theyre going to everybodys going to be picking it up and its going its going to be played you know time and time again
okay but but the question is is that okay krlds going to play it first
yes
just because of local curiosity right
well not because of local curiosity because you asked it i mean you told me that
exactly i understand but
okay
but when is what time are they going to play it
as soon as you give it to me
oh i see okay but of course its real its real late now
well no
okay but thats all right anyway
i mean you know like
because theyll probably play it more than once
like like if we get it at at 5 oclock whatever theyll start playing it then
right
and theyll continue playing it you realize that
okay
okay and then
but when is when is the national going to play it
well they told us that they will play it from 10 oclock to 3 oclock but thats
in the morning
huh yes but thats thats in thats arizona time which means it will be 11 oclock here when you know when you start
eleven to
until until 4
right okay okay
now how are you feeling
like i said its you know im weak but still i feel better i mean you know i mean physically yes but you know spiritually i feel a lot better
people people were saying that they were saying that they didnt think because i was talking so strong and all of that for a while that that id actually been shot but then tonight on the news one of the swat team officers said that he was the one that shot me he he shot me twice so that confirms it
well
i mean i
the
i was just i was just looking out the you know
the the concern that i have
the way there but
well look whats the foundation of religion whats man afraid of above anything in the world whats man afraid of by nature
death
death exactly okay so the scripture says in hebrews that christ died and rose from the grave so that he would have power over him that had power over dead which was the devil and redeem them who through their lives were afraid of death and therefore subject to bondage see some people in religion i mean like the jews back in those days they were so afraid of dying and being punished of god that they didnt really see the real meaning of the law the law was a revelation of a divine nature and they didnt understand the prophets how the law was to be properly interpreted they didnt really look to the animal sacrifices for what it really meant you know killing a lamb is really a dramatic thing
um hum
you know its sad something innocent has to die
um hum
because you did something wrong but the but the main key goes way back to cain and abel you know cain didnt want to kill the lamb did he no he wanted to bring his own fruits right
right
but when god blessed abel and didnt bless cain cain could kill his brother couldnt he
um hum
so you see this story repeats itself so those who do what god wishes you see according to gods word theyre like abels and those who do not do gods wishes well then theyre like cains
um hum
so now the question right now between us and you guys was which one was the cain and which one was the abel
well
you know or maybe we were both one and the same
um hum well
but
i will
let me ask you this and when i was talking to one of the ladies there earlier she indicated that theres some nurses in there that may be you know kind of looking out after you
well theyve been like changing these weve been using like sheets
okay
off a bed and wrapping it around tied it up and then it gets wet so then we if i lay still for a while and if i dont laugh i mean this is not funny like id be laughing but
um hum
you know sometimes you laugh for nothing better else to do but if i dont laugh and if i dont cough then it stops bleeding
um hum
but if i move a certain way or laugh or especially cough then boy it starts coming out again
im working on it
additionally you know does anybody in there have a a blood pressure cup that they can take your blood pressure
oh yeah
you you have one
oh yeah weve got weve got
dont touch it dont touch it because its you know someone was touching the cord and its jittery
oh okay
so that what i do is i i always teach with questions
okay
so i i teach my students i say now look i cant save you you know i am not anything as far as you can see any different from what you can see you know
um hum
we are not to worship men so ill tell them look this is a ill make them read the revelation of who who gave it to him what reason then when i take them throughout the revelation their eyes are seeing the book their mind is developing pictures so that when we get into the part of the seals they see very clearly the scripture teaches that none but the lamb can reveal these things and i go now wait right here the lamb reveals it he reveals the first seal is a man on a white horse
um hum
now you know whats so hard about understanding that apparently it seems like hes going to war seems like christ is not only a savior hes a destroyer conquering and conquering except we cant speculate can we of course they agree with me i says now we shouldnt add our opinions because we really dont know the details of this i says look here at the second seal they are given a great sword that they should kill one another i said now why how does that reveal jesus you know christ doesnt teach to kill one another you know he teaches love and turn the cheek doesnt he
um hum
so we cant speculate here
um hum
so then when we get to chapter 10 after we begin to read throughout the seven seals the trumpets start in the seventh seal my students are brought to the attention of very strange and weird symbols or omens which again speculation is not the facts
um hum
now we get to chapter 10 we see that sometime during the sixth trumpet john records and i saw another mighty angel sent from heaven clothed with a cloud and as faded as it were the sun you know and his feet as pillars of fire stood up on the earth and sea had his little handbook opened and he cries and a lion roareth when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now again we dont know what this is all about all we know is that the only thunders we know about is in gods throne the lightning thunders and voices we know when the lamb opens the first seal there is the first thunder but it says john is told to seal those things and write them not but john was told that the mighty angel swore by the god that created all things when theres time no longer this mystery of god will be finished so see my students begin to think about those things what is this mystery of the the little book thats opened whats this mystery of the the revelation of jesus christ and of course the last chapter when we learn about the river of the water of life we know that christ is the lord god of the holy prophets you know christ is the one who from the beginning of time spake into the prophets because he is the word of god
um hum
made angel or hes the word of god made flesh it depends on what the will of the father really is but the keynote is he promised he says i sent my angel and he says i come upwards with me so then at that point my students begin to realize that the coming of christ has something to do with a message a message that only he can reveal
um hum
so then i ask them well would you like to learn the seven seals now of course they look at me real funny then dont they
um hum
yeah see once we get that established about the judgment that only the lamb can reveal these things and when i ask them would you like me to show you the seals i wont tell you but ill show you then they look at me real funny like well hey you cant show me these things and i go well thats right i cant but christ can right well yeah i says well let me show you something here in chapter three of revelation it says these saith he that is holy he hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth i go what is that key of course they dont know and i go let me show you i tell them theres 150 psalms that david of ove [phonetic_sp] wrote the psalms you know
um hum
and christ is the root and offspring of david isnt he
um hum
god promised david to christ that one day god would sit on the throne of david in the flesh of christ right
um hum
and that was fulfilled in christ
yeah
so then i began to take them to the 45th psalm and i go now lets open this psalm up and lets look at what gods thinking about when you come up here to my church youll see the father sitting on the throne and the reason why he wants to know who can reveal his thoughts is because he put his thoughts down in a book he does this so that we can receive mercy and grace instead of wraths or unrighteousness which is not too righteous so then the 45th psalm begins to talk in behalf of god now i always emphasize at my students stop looking at me theyve got to look at god they got to be in the spirit
um hum
so then when this 45th psalm starts saying my heart is inditing a good matter you know were looking at the rock right were looking at god whose got the book right
um hum
and we already know the first seal pertains to a man on a white horse right
um hum
so whose heart is it davids heart or is it gods heart well the scripture says david was a man after gods own heart not in the same magnitude but nonetheless the same spirit of the future where the son of god was to be made manifest god says his hearts inditing a good matter he wants to talk about the things he has made hes a creator isnt he
um hum
touching his king
um hum
and his tongue is the pen of a ready writer so its written in the book isnt it
um hum
so that we find in psalms 45 that he does write prosperously he does have a bow he does have a crown because of truth now that doesnt mean that when christ comes hes going to come on a white horse with a bow and shoot people in the heart in their heart with an arrow but it does mean that theres a truth that must be made known because the real thing to emphasize in that 45th psalm is when it says upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir now the question is who is that queen is she a literal girl or is she a church nonetheless whether shes literal or spiritual nonetheless love is literal whether we love christ spiritually or whether we love him literally theyre one in the same okay now it says hearken o daughter and consider now whether were a girl or not all of us who have eyes to see should consider in the 45th psalm who god has revealed so that in revelation 19 when the marriage lamb comes its very clear in that chapter who that man on the white horse is and it says that he has a name of course in 19 it says behold i saw a white horse and he that sat upon him had a crown many crowns on his head he takes those crowns off the leeches of the earth youll find in other prophecies it says he has a vesture dipped in blood and his name is the word of god okay
um hum
so the keynote is that we begin to learn that what the revelation is is its a well look you know you know in a movie when they want to advertise a movie
uh huh
they dont they dont sit there and give you 15 20 minutes of the movie do they with advertisement what do they give you a preview right
exactly
okay so if the mystery of god the seven thunders are the seven seals if it is to be finished as god declared to the prophets then found in the prophecies are the seven seals
um hum
and youll find that in the first seal the truth there is about christ destroying his enemies
um hum
and the only enemies he destroys are those who are against his truth
um hum
and thats regarding the marriage which unitifies [sic] humanity and divinity into one mind only gods thoughts are worth anything you see mans thoughts are vanity
um hum
but gods thoughts are eternal
um hum
so through truth we learn why christ says in the gospel of john when he says my hes having a fight with the sanhedrin remember
um hum
and the pharisee says my doctrine is not mine its that which i received from my father
um hum
so hes trying to tell him its gods book he says now if you continue in my doctrine youre my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
uh huh
now you know no ones free today right were all in bondage [indiscernible] arent we
um hum
so we have to learn these seals
um hum
of course we dont just learn the seals we do the seals
um hum
as we learn the seals we do the seals
um hum
obedience not just hearing but obedience
um hum
so anyway if you ever get a chance to read the 45th psalm look at it judge it for yourself
okay
and look at the first seal and see if those things kind of look exactly alike
well what im going to do is im going to tell everybody
uh huh
what my negotiations with you are
okay
and in so doing everybody will know that when we have done and completed our work then weve done our work and everything and theres no reason to die because like i say the truth is to give life its not to give death
right
and the whole key is this you know christians in general believe that if they shall serve god they shall be persecuted
um hum
but in our generation even though sin does abound great is a lot let me say this much though sin abounds greatly more so than ever before
um hum
the point still is as graced as much more abound
um hum
remember the seals are not revealed to condemn us or destroy us theyre theyre revealed so that all those who profess christ can come together into one body
um hum
thats what brings the fall of confusion theres too many organizations professing to believe in one god
yeah
oh it scares me
okay
professing to believe in one god and yet theres only one doctrine remaining for us to know to bring us all into unity
um hum
of the faith you know we cant have faith and and presumption
hello
yeah
whats causing that
i dont know it must be your cord somebody must be stepping on it or pulling at it or something
right okie doke okay let me
now you because of because of the way that you have revealed the seals and and your understanding of the biblical readings i have to assume that everybody thats contained within there
theres two plans god always gives two ways out
okay
you see god see if you had a better if you had a better understanding of the prophecies for instance in isaiah where it says behold for the mountains of fear that brings good tidings
um hum
its a sad story of isaiah 52 and 53
um hum
okay but whereas in nahum behold will the mountains it tells you a different story
um hum
not that the two prophecies do not harmonize but god has a plan like in ezekiel where god says that if i shall pronounce a blessing against a people you know because theyve kept my laws you know then if they shall break my laws that the blessing that i pronounced against them i will take away and if i also curse a nation than it shall be no more that i shall destroy if it turned from its wicked ways then will i also turn from my evil which i have proposed to do and will bless them so ezekiel tells us in 33rd chapter that you know god has no pleasure in the death of the wicked
um hum
no pleasure
um hum
so the thing of it is that like paul says in hebrews 6 he says that that therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ he says the doctrine of baptism and resurrection you know hes talking about the simple things you know the very first steps in christianity he says lets go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of these simple doctrines you know the basic things like jesus loves me and he died for me and i must be baptized you know we we do that once right
um hum
he says for its impossible for those who were once enlightened if they shall fall away in other words dont progress with truth you know peter says be established in the present truth which means if theres a present truth there must be a past truth if if theres like we might believe the message of noah now right
um hum
but in the days of noah no one believed it
um hum
they perished because of unbelief
right
now we may believe the message of moses but the message of moses is over those in his day didnt believe it
um hum
but you see now we may believe the message of christ 2 000 years ago
um hum
but of course when it was being given nobody believed it
right
you see thats the whole thing now today weve got one final revelation of course you know everyone believes in jesus today
um hum
just like everyone believed in moses in christs day
yeah
but maybe they dont know that christ like they should
youre right
so you offer them the seven seals you know and well like 2 000 years ago you know the sanhedrin says to christ we be not the sons born of fornication sure its easy today to accept christ as a virgin birth right
um hum
but back then the general public view was that he was born mary had had fornication with somebody
um hum
you know so you know they always see christ as lovely and meek but when you when you read whats going on oh when you read the gospels he could throw over some tables at the church couldnt he
um hum
he was considered radical by a lot of people
right
but certain people just pick up highlights of his nature and dont look at the other side
um hum
so when he warns us in the book of revelation he gives specific counsels to the churches of asia hey the lord dont mess around he tells church of ephesus returning to the first verse there ill take your candle away
um hum
now if you walk in darkness youre going to end up in hell you know smyrna thyatira sardis they ought to see he tells them that theyre lukewarm hot or cold he says ill spew you out of my mouth who and is that the same christ we learn about on the cross hey you just you just let a man crucify you once
thats right
and then the thing of it is the guy says im sorry okay can forgive him but then he needs to open his eyes and he needs to learn a little obedience doesnt he
um hum
okay but the thing of it is if he turns away from you the second time isnt he crucifying you afresh
really
you would think okay so now by the world turned away from these seven seals just because im ugly or they may think im crazy you know i didnt think were supposed to judge anybody according to flesh
really well i think that that youre going to reveal the way to you know to safety for for your people you know and were going to of course afford you the opportunity to make that tape do you think youre going to be working on that very soon
yeah im fixing to get on it right now
okay well i just want you
this is what ive been wanting for the longest time
i realize that
as you know christ youre supposed to walk in him thats what the new covenant teaches us but at the same time youre not supposed to reject any additional light that comes
thats right
youre supposed to grow into the full stature of the body of christ
um hum
and your faith virtue virtue and the knowledge in all his temperance you know like i say were supposed to grow as colossians says
thats right
receiving the knowledge in him when it comes all the new testament writers if you really read those writings again romans all the way through youll find all of them are talking about one day christ is going to come and reveal seals thats what theyre all talking about about that knowledge of of that god had bodily you know
um hum
talking about the knowledge of the of the spirit thats within christ
um hum
so seven seals
okay i want you
because christ is one body all the prophets and apostles are hid in one body
um hum
one bread and one wine
um hum
one truth so you gentiles are were supposed to have an opportunity too in the latter days and were here there now and you know why would why would christ come back as a holy and and perfect person when you all dont even believe in the law anymore
um hum
even though the law was nailed to the cross wasnt it
thats right
but you know because the law is nailed to the cross now you take a look at the law and he and he says father forgive them so how much more you who stands down at the foot of the cross are to forgive your neighbor
um hum
one sinner to another sinner you know should forgive one another
thats right
but even more so we should realize that that good spirit went into the hand of god and the word theres three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
um hum
and thats where we have to really pay attention if we want to win the reward of righteousness
um hum
to realize it in every generation they would not hear the prophets because like hosea he had to marry two prostitute wives didnt he
um hum
okay isaiah walked naked and barefoot so did micah
um hum
i mean god does obstacles like you would never think someone like someone like samson could be a judge of israel could you
thats right
i mean but you know he went around and messed around with philistine women didnt he
um hum
and the father says is there never a daughter amongst my own brethren and he says no get this philistine girl for me because she pleased me well the scripture says for they knew not that it was of the lord for lord had an occasion against the philistines you know just so much stuff in the scripture people overlook about the mysterious ways so back at christ in his day he says regard ye amongst the heathen and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days that you will not believe though it be told you and then he talks about destroying the nations by discovering the foundation unto the neck well if you didnt know daniel 2s prophecy about the image we talked about earlier
um hum
you would never know what it meant in regards to discovering the foundation what is the foundation well the foundation of the kingdom of god is in truth and the truth is in the days of these kings daniel says gods tolerance of the gentile nations ruling over his people is over gods going to gather back the hundred and four thousand gods going to choose the jews because the gentiles are going to do worse to a messiah who comes who comes to teach the truth than what the jews did 2 000 years ago and i would do anything to avoid that to keep that from happening
okay
okay
but but help me
so let me get this tape
help me understand what your role is you are with respect to revealing the seals is it the lamb
well remember the lamb well look in psalms 4 that will tell you who i am
okay
see psalms 1 psalms 2 remember the anointed one the heathen rage
um hum
and they say lets break their bands asunder
um hum
what ties the son to the father the word
um hum
and what portion of gods word has been sealed seven truths of the bible right
um hum
okay now the challenge is for anybody in the world my friend
okay
anybody so in psalms 3 the psalm goes on to say lord how are they increased to trouble me for they be many that rise up against me there be many say of my soul theres no help for him in god but it also says ill be not afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves together against me round about in psalms 4 it says help lord it says hear me when i call o god of my righteousness then it says o you sons of men how long will you love vanity how long will you turn my glory into shame how long will you seek after leasing he tells them he says but you should know that god has separated him apart that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him yes stand in awe and sin not serve the lord with fear rejoice with trembling you see
um hum
meditate upon your own bed
okay
now see the thing of it that psalm all the psalms are a dialogue of christ you see the sons of men turn his glory to shame because they dont know where hes coming from
um hum
you know who has god separated apart thats godly for himself who christ
um hum
and heaven christ but when he comes again according to whats written with the bands and the seals
um hum
and the by the book is written of me theyre not going to know what god has already said because theyre not going to listen to what god says
um hum
only what god says can reveal who we are
um hum
and either we are with the same wheel of god or were not
yeah
okay so ill make this tape and that way
good
people can copy it and they can go over it a few times
well im going to have a little chicken soup now i think
well like i said you know lets make this arrangement lets get this tape done and what time is it anyway im im upside down when it comes to time
its about a quarter after 1
oh its already 1 oclock huh
um hum
well can we start this again at 6 oclock in the morning is that all right
well you know there are just so many children
i know there is theres a lot of them here but you said you was going to do something for me now
yes
and i was doing this the way im doing it now to see what kind of trust i could develop in jim
well now
you know
well
okay now
at one time now you now you do you believe that
ill have to be carried
well well carry you out
okay
now
okay good
okay
okay i want to tell you something
i dont want you to come in
just to show you my good faith is you know we called krld
uh huh
theres nobody answering the phone there so were sending somebody there
well theres one number over the line that can the normal number they wont answer right now so yeah okay so if you sent someone there thats fine
um hum okay now are you ready to send somebody out now
yeah
okay
you got the van there
everybody
thats correct
yeah because like unless see what im on right now is like i said you know when i got hit
um hum
took everything in my power to just feel the to crawl okay
well no we dont want you to crawl
and finally well let me explain finally what happened was i couldnt i just i mean everything was getting numb
yeah
so i finally ended up where im at now
um hum
and that just that was it i couldnt go no more
okay
and so you know its like we got a whats this thing called a sponge a sponge kind of you know halfway on the sponge
yeah
my back halfway on a pillow
yeah
you know on blankets and then i got this
okay now
towels or sheets wrapped around my holes in my stomach
okay now how much time do you want us to give you to make the tape
well like i say we should we should have something done by at least 6 in the morning
okay
is that all right [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] i mean because because see no ones no ones going to want to play it for you know for any more than 30 minutes thats just the way even even standardized you know short sermons are no more than 30 minutes so in order for me to be able to to make my statements clear im going to have to you know take a breath and im going to have to speak as clear as i can
okay i
you know and then im going to have to stop it were going to have to to edit it and and code it and then put it all together to where it doesnt because i dont want to sound like [making_panting_noises] you know
yeah right
i dont want i dont want that could be distracting
well i feel a lot better now because youre doing this for me
okay
its you know one thing about human weakness i used to run track
um hum
and i used to be a long distance runner
okay
and the thing of it is is that when you start seeing that final stretch you know and you pace yourself
um hum
its a mental thing
okay
then that last little bit of stretch you know you get this new wind
um hum
okay
and except i just drink a little orange juice to wet my mouth but im going to get some chicken soup and we need to send a couple of children out to you now
okay
because its getting kind of late
uh huh
okay [unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] all right let me get that [groaning] uh oh now i cant get now dont hit me but reach over there and get it it fell down the side of me okay all right

i guess whatever christ says those who hear will find very haunting therefore god is lest ye forever well gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty is christ the most mighty with thy [indiscernible] thy majesty i mean it seems like in revelation all in heaven bowed before the lamb did they not thats a lot of glory but ill explain received power honor glory riches wisdom kingdom might oh thats a lot of inheritance there especially the gospel says i received all things my father says [indiscernible] because of truth so what could this truth be some truths in the bible talks about riding a horse prosperously and its truth could it be revelations could it be the first seal maybe a truth about christ maybe a truth about him being a king [indiscernible] crown could it be a truth about him having a horse riding conquering into conquerors huh [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]

okay
you you pick four of your guys now nobody thats injured just pick four able bodied men
right okay right right
okay no firearms

yeah
well david and you can can you know agree with me and then we can explain it to everyone and and they can understand it and we appreciate their concern and im what im were so concerned that it go smoothly we dont want any
exactly
yeah
thats thats oh believe me thats the main concern thats the main concern
okay all right
so what well do then is like you
well all right let me let me talk to the commanders and and one
okay thanks jim
be one second okay
okay sure
hey just hang on
i will i am
hosea seems to say the word is that youre not high people there should be said youre the sons of the living god so [indiscernible] says in the gospel if he calls him god [indiscernible] the laws not be broken well learning gods word and gods spirit this is what makes us become born again born by the spirit acknowledging god well so so a girl believes in god so does everybody else that believes in god so therefore god the father has many children doesnt he christ being the firstborn and thereon everything all thereafter did believe but instead of my father should be my children and thou mayest make princes in all the earth to the person that doesnt really understand scripture this would seem to be a very controversial subject i mean christ never had any wife has to be spiritual i will make thy name remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever well even if it is spiritual we know one thing we the servants of god know that psalm 45 is the very prophecy which must be hereafter according to the first seal but just to make sure we know its going to be fulfilled lets turn in our bibles to revelation 19 just so we can get a better caption of what we are really looking at now remember in the 18th chapter of revelation we know that babylon the great fall she made all nations drink of some kind of wine of the wrath of her fornication now we find that something very bad happened and at verse 23 of chapter 18 no more light of a candle shall shine there nor the voice of the bridegroom or the voice of the bride well the merchants were the great men of the earth it says in verse 23 and for their by thy sorceries were all nations deceived we all know about capitalization we know about advertisement selling something making it better than what it really is and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth you see just because people dont accept the truth in gods word does not mean its not true theres some truth that we might teach could get us in trouble but anyway the first chapter 19 it says and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in the heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power to the lord our god why for true and righteous are his judgments i wonder [indiscernible] [tape_continues_playing]

okay
okay im back
hey listen let me tell you the rest of this way this things going to go so youre clued in you know i can tell david later but what were going to do later is were going to get weve got buses okay
um hum
weve got like four buses out on the highway
um hum
and were going to take those buses and some of these you know bulletproof vehicles and move them all together up so you you can walk to them
and when are you going to do that
well not now not until after the broadcast
okay
or maybe during the broadcast but just i want to let you know thats going to happen
okay
you know
how many buses again
i think we got four
four buses
were not sure about that i mean were just you know trying to get the number of people from the number of people you just gave us were trying to work out you know what size bus how many seats you know
and where are they going to move them to in front of the gate or
were not sure exactly but they just have to go over to the buses
down the road in front of our property or where
yeah no they wont be on your property
somebody sitting in front of the property on the road there or
[unidentified_male_voice_in_background_not_discernible] well what theyll probably be is a little bit away like youll come out your driveway onto double e ranch road
um hum
and then youll youll walk left a little while just walk to where you see them youll see them as soon as you turn but were just going to put them down the road a little bit
okay
okay thats just for your safety our safety
okay
and you just can walk right to where those buses are
okay
id say how far down the double e road
uh huh
probably you know about as little longer than your driveway its not going to be that bad

okay
the compound the fbi agents then added onto the front of it 8 to 10 seconds in which david koresh agrees upon the broadcast of this tape to come out peacefully with all persons inside and then theres a 4 second pause and then we get into the body of the 58 minute tape that was sent out to the fbi agents and charlie i guess if youll just tell me the the what the time looks like and and when its time to roll the tape well be ready to go
weve got a minute and 15 seconds by the our studio clock here and well go by that so if you can stand by well give you a countdown as we get closer to it again rick i want to thank you i know its been an incredibly stressful time for you there and not knowing what was around the corner and having to face up to it in an incredibly professional manner and i thank you for all your service and and you can have a couple of days off when we get out of this so you can catch up on your sleep because i plan to do the same can we ask one more question
sure
with the agreement that they will peacefully leave the compound is it your understanding rick that will be after the broadcast or during the broadcast when it begins
i dont know bob thats between the fbi negotiators and david koresh from the listening to the first few seconds of it i get the impression that once the broadcast starts the peaceful surrender will begin but thats just based on the words i heard
okay
time will tell it will well have to depend on our reporters and well have to qualify that so that people dont have expectations thats an assumption on our part we really dont know having not been a party to the negotiations we cannot give you any certainty to the the contents of the tape we need to do a legal id here bob this is krld dallas fort worth it is 130
the tape youre about to hear was given to krld news 42 minutes ago by two fbi agents who came from the command post at the pspi the old connolly [phonetic_sp] air force base [indiscernible] [radio_continues_playing_intermittently_discernible]
is someone confirming to them that its after the tape or
the the
because they think that its its going to begin after they start the tape not at the end of the tape
well no its after the end dont worry about that you and i work that out
okay
yeah
by the request of the fbi and david koresh at 130 [following_is_the_tape_being_played_over_the_radio]
i david koresh agree upon the broadcasting of this tape to come out peacefully with all the people immediately
now we will have a few seconds before the beginning of the 58 minute
march 2nd 1993 my name is dave koresh im speaking to you from mt carmel center the first thing that i would like to introduce in our subject is the reasons for the revelation of jesus christ in the book of revelations commentary states that what john has written in scripture is nothing other than the revelation of jesus christ which god gave to him to show to his servants things which much shortly come to pass and he signified it signified it by his angel into service john now
rachel
john [indiscernible]
hello rachel
the record of god and the word of christ and of all things that he saw in the first chapter of revelation it says blessed is the man blessed is he readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and those who keep the things that are written therein for the time is at hand [indiscernible] john writes this to the seven churches which are in asia

hey rachel
yes
we see the burdens of these ancient writers
okay yeah okay
