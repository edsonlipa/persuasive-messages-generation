ive already told you that and i havent lied to ya
well youre gonna get em all wrapped up so tell you what id be a dumb thing to do and youre probably gonna regret that for the rest of your life and
mm hm whats the purpose of all that you know ah this thing isnt gonna last forever you know youre gonna get youre gonna do a little bit of time and we both know that but tah what the hell its gonna end and life goes on you can solve these problems if you let your problems ah do you in you know youve had it you cant do that youve gotta come off the side a little bit a best way to do this is stand up like a man
well as i said before i think youre selling yourself short on that
but youre making assumptions that you only have a few choices and i dont think thats necessarily the case
well we dont know that for a fact yet <name> youre making an assumption
then again the people that youre trying to help they need you
well again thats just an assumption and youre selling yourself short
but thats you know if thats having an effect on you now hopefully they can deal with that and any problems youve had up to this point you can attribute directly to that ya know so write that off its not a problem
well ive got some people trying to find him he he came to work today but he went out in the field uh theyre trying to get him by radio if they cant do that they think they know where he was going and theyre gonna try and go and find him
well again hes not at home uh an associate says that he still is in the city but theyre not sure exactly where in the city he might be so were trying to track that down for you too [pause] uh do you remember a guy named <name>
thats where you sell yourself short the people that youre trying to to work for are just grasping at anybody to carry em along to to get some cohesiveness to the group so they can make some moves
well i dont think <name> s gonna trust you to the point when you have uh the guns that you have
well i dont think anyone including reverend <name> is gonna come to you as long as you have those weapons
again all of those people i am sure all of them would bring the dog to you as long as you didnt have the weapons
id like to get your dog to you but there has to be a more reasonable way to get the dog to you than to ask someone to walk into that office there while you have all those weapons what do you
i think you need to turn it around start thinking the other direction where you go from here and what you can do for people
im not trying to con you im telling you facts that i have
youve got to trust to trust me
for me to con you would be stupid
i can accomplish that for you but i cant do it as long as youre in there as as an armed camp i cant ask anybody and i dont know anybody else that would ask anybody to come in and and try and deliver your dog as long as your armed like that
well i cant imagine anybody doing it under these circumstances
but in the meantime your dogs cowering in a corner scared to death
well i dont think so i think theres a lot of room and you could do a lot of things and theres plenty of help available [pause] okay
you have the whole system available to you its up to you now to use it the whole system is waiting and you can work that system any way you want to your advantage
so i says you know ive talked to the guy and hes concerned that were going to you know same old story were going to all zap ourselves you know why wouldnt we have zapped ourselves already anyway henry i mean come on
okay and and thats fine i have no problem i you know i want to get you as soon as i can to receive some medical attention
and thats why ive been wanting to get you know working from my end pushing the bosses here to find me a way to get this into prime time or national radio station or whatever so that i can get you some medical attention
but they have no yeah they dont have the they dont have the capability to shoot
the the cannon and the muzzles were removed so everything should be fine
okay what wed like to do david is wed like to continue working as we were before wed like to continue bringing out additional children as best as we can with the same agreement that we had before and wed like to work if possible you know everybody has a concern here about you we feel that you know that youre not really taking care of yourself we dont want anything to happen to you wed like for you to consider coming out yourself we want everybody to come out we want everybody to come out of this alive we dont want you to give up and we feel that you are thats a great concern to to all of us
well one of the concerns that we have you know that i feel that you may have is you mentioned earlier that you felt that people were calling you a cult leader okay if you give up that may in fact be the impression that everybody has whereas if you continue to fight in terms of trying to save your life and continue to lead your people thats not the impression that will be created
youve been a family person okay and your family
and your family needs you and everybody wants to see you come out of this alive
everybody needs you these people need you the kids need you
no no thats not possible thats not possible we made an agreement
we made an agreement they cant nobody can be there make sure ask again
no they are not on the roof nobody is even close listen the agreements that we made david the agreements that jim made with you all stand we are not
no nobody is there i promise you nobody is there we every agreement that we made before stands
we want this thing to be resolved in such a fashion that everybody comes out of this fine we dont want anybody else to get hurt thats number one number two if you have a message we certainly would like for you to

okay now try to keep it short because you know the these people are not going to want to play something thats real long okay
and you know we we had some initial difficulties about you know how long they would play it but we we really hung in there and and stood up
we stood up and said listen you know we want you to play his whole message
no editing we we really stood firm for you so i i hope you realize that
okay this is what we want to do were the people at the network we like i say we we battled them to get the whole message and and they they said they will do it and its an hour its a solid hour david
well as soon as as soon as this is all done thats when i told him that that you know i would i would give all that information out
thats what we originally worked out
okay well what were oh i understand that and and we trust you and we just want to kind of prepare in advance you know to have some buses out there so we can take you together and you know you know we instead of a bunch of cars and we were kind of hoping that you know you would lead the way you know some of the folks might be scared and
well david youve kept your word and so have we
and ill tell you our only reason for these questions about the people is just logistical you know
so we can call ahead to the hospital to say look we have a man who has an arm wound we have a you know david has a wound in his lower abdomen you know so they can prepare to treat you
thats the only reason i mean im not i mean theres no secret behind it and then just to have the number of vehicles there you remember the glitches we had the other day when the car wasnt ready and then the people at the christian broadcast network you know their their position and and you understand the news okay
and then also i dont want it to get dark on us and that many people getting ready you know with the children the mothers would take a little while
you know you know just get a head count tell her to take a piece of paper just count everybody and that will help us with the buses and then the the other thing is especially important is you know people who cant walk yourself and any others can we
well thats thats another reason for us to make these preparations david you know what i mean
i dont know i dont know thats another reason not to delay because were going to get the message on and and once it is you know theres no reason for you not to get that medical care just as quick as we can
well listen after you walk out of there and your your words going to get out even more im telling you its going to get out even more
the truth will get out when when you come out of there even more so just remember that okay
well its a big place and we were concerned that everybody in the inside got the word you know and that there wasnt somebody off in a room that that didnt get the word you know
all right and i trust you and you trust me
all the trust i want all the trust of everyone in there do you
okay and make those arrangements because we we want to get you out right after your message is played
so you can get some treatment
okay and you know how everybodys concerned about money and i mean everybody is has a concern can you do me a favor and can you make it you know like in such a fashion that that in order to avoid their wanting to chop it up or to play part of it or whatever
oh i dont have any idea i have no idea but what id like to do is i would like for you to make it as concise and as brief as you can make it so that we can be in a situation where your word will will get out nothing will be chopped off your message will go out as you want it you know
we dont need that we what we want is we want you to you were given your cooperation and thats what we promised what we would do so i want to live up to my part of it yeah i dont need your money but i do need [touch_tone_sounds]
okay now now listen listen to what im going to tell you i dont know if this van is going to stop in exactly the same place as the other van its going to be real close the only reason that im telling you that is whoevers going to take the kids there you know these are two new people because weve had a changing of a shift okay so
but but i mean you know they may be 20 feet back or or 5 feet forward from where they parked before i dont want her to get a concern whoever it is thats taking them there well its they didnt park in exactly the same place nothings
going to happen other than what has happened before
we want to we want to continue in that same vein we dont want to change anything or or make anything in such a fashion you know and when you kept telling me that there was somebody in that tower or in the roof i knew that there wasnt anybody you know because
well he was busy
no <name> i honestly dont know i aint telling you no bull i just i dont know no more to tell you than what im told
theyre not necessarily the ones who are going to serve it you know a warrant a warrants not the end of the end of the world
id like to hear your side of it
ok well theyll get you one then thats the law you know
well shes busy right now you know you and i can work this out ok because im the one whos going to talk to the <name> for you you know they got me out of bed in the middle of the night and said theres a guy up here hes got a problem thats what im doing here ok so if i got up in the middle of the night let me work on it for you alright you understand what i am saying
well let me prove it to you im not going to get up in the middle of the night and come all the way up here from <place> to lie to somebody if i was going to do that i wouldnt have made the trip lets talk about the warrant and and you know a solution ok
we get this out of the way and you can talk to your mother twenty four hours a day
yes but we might we might need to use the phone to get this authority through so lets lets keep it simple and well handle one thing at a time
but that aint what i been asking for
if i can talk to her i can probably slighten the problem a little bit
well shes shes not the appropriate person to talk to about you know about this kind of situation your mothers not going to talk to the attorney general you know i dont have any problem with you talking to your mother but lets take first things first here
mhm mhm see thats delaying what we want to do in getting this getting this thing this warrant handled because the <name> may have to call somebody
you know shes been up all night too you ought to give her a break
well you probably wont have to go anywhere but you know the reason the reason im talking about the warrant and so forth and and and i know you want to talk to your mother is to handle things one thing at a time get them done you know the right way and then theres no problem telling to your mother but we we just got the one phone here and we are going to do some checking on this warrant so we are going to need this phone in other words we are working together on this thing we are working for you so your gonna have to understand that ok so im if if you need me try to call me and if the phone is busy that means we are calling somebody about this warrant to find out some of the details how we can handle the thing and but if you need me and you can get through to me ask for <name> ok
and its important i need to talk to her
well i can come later i need to talk to her now my little girl is going to have to come first
thats why i need to talk to her
dont you think if we handle something in your interest that thats in hers too
well i know that but you know we dont know each other to well right
and those are some of the things you know that i gotta make sure arent going to happen just like i said im going to help you right if you let me help you
you know im not going to bs you ok im going to be realistic with you but on the same token on the same hand you know i id like for us to do something together and thats thats basically regarding the baby there we dont have any problems unless we make problems
and that baby is going to be waking up pretty soon i dont know about you but im not a very good babysitter i dont get enough practice for one thing that sure would make things easier for us im talking about you and i if we can get that thing resolved
ok how about if we talk about it first so we dont have any mistakes do it the simplest way possible
mhm mhm see thats a thats a problem for for ah for some of the people here whether they can trust you or not
i know i know that might sound funny to you you know but you and i dont know each other that well and you know ive gotta responsibility that if you know <name> and i talk about this and <name> and i make a deal that <name> is gonna gonna to do what he says ive already promised you im going to do what i say bound by that
yes but you you gotta understand that you know we are responsible down here
well its better to get it all from you did you ever play that game when you were a kid in school where you pass around something around the table this guy says something to this guy and this guy says something to that guy and by the time it gets around the table its a little different
well believe me that happens so so thats why i want to talk to you about it so that they dont lose anything in what they call lose it in translation does that make sense to you
if youre gonna do something do the right thing in good faith lets lets help you out too ok
well resolve the other thing with the warrant i think you are going to have a pretty good day
ok ok <name> let me ill get your <name> for you ok but we gotta i im not trying to cut you off here but i wanna limit the time that you have with her on the phone because we are going to need the phone to take care of this other problem ok
why not what what what can what would i accomplish by lying to you
well thats basically really what we are talking about here i told im im not going to lie to you and im not it it doesnt it doesnt do any good to do that you know if we are if we are gonna come to an agreement on this thing its gotta be based on the truth you said that the thing you didnt like is you dont want to go to jail well youre not going to jail what they are going to do is book you and thats in one door and out the other
yes what what would that that wouldnt serve any purpose
first ok well go with well go with your suggestion on this thing well take care of all that other stuff too well well take one thing at a time we proved to each other that we are not im not trying to bs you i didnt come up here to do that i came up here to help you let me get right back to you ok <name>
well its just in in best interest <name> is all
im keeping my word
shes on the way i cant stop her
they theyre going out the door right now
you see i misunderstood you then you said let me talk to i said that i was goning your <name> was coming up to get <name> and you said we will let me talk to her first and thats when i put you mother on see you and i havent talked that much about <name> you said that that you were lied to because you were going to talk to <name> but you and i you and i never talked about that you understand that
and what i wanted was a show of good faith from you you know you are going to have to let me help you if i am going to help you you understand my my situation
well that was our deal i thought that that you were gonna have you <name> pick up <name> and then talk to <name> see thats why thats why you know it sounds like im going into details here and i am because i dont wanna i dont wanna do the wrong thing see i didnt understand that
well because because youre not doing anything in your own best interest and thats is letting your <name> pick up <name> what do you want to talk to <name> about
hes going to get you out of trouble you wont have to go to jail
well thats like he said youll be going in one door and out the other one
you didnt kill nobody its not that bad
what did he tell you said i would have to spend ten days in jail and pay a fine ten days well thats better than year
what else you want they did a lot for you theyre getting you out of trouble
well youd rather talk to a psychiatrist than go to jail wouldnt you
ok well i wanna hug her <name>
let me help you out of this situation i know i know that right now it doesnt look that great but gees dont dont get all bent out of shape about it you know we can work it out and remember i said before its a walk through that still holds we can still do that <name> youll be out drinking <name> in the early morning sun
that we are still going to get this warrant i told you we are going to get the warrant held that way we still can get it held that way nobody is going to come in there and rough you up or anything like that and and <name> said that you know hed give you a ride down there would you let me prove that to you
sure you did and you are if i had an uncle in <place> and i got in trouble he could sign my bond doesnt matter where you live the bond is the bond you know your mother trusts you and shes taking responsibility by signing a bond
ok sooner you get down there sooner you get out
because i wanna prove to you im a man of my word ok
and do it for you too ok
youre coming back
youre not gonna go to jail
i understand what youre saying i dont have control over that what i what ill do is ill do the best that i can but i want you to understand that if it comes out chopped up it has nothing to do with me you know were we
okay well okay what ill do is i will i will see how things work out ill do the best i can for you i cant guarantee anything on this because of the length of the tape so please dont be upset at me because you know well just do the best that we can [unidentified_voice_in_background_not_discernible]
because theyre good theyre good old ladies
no no no no no that has nothing to do with anything if i told you that i was going to do something thats exactly what im going to do you know i i have no problems doing you know this and whatever you know
and you know and likewise ive been trusting you okay
but the press was saying last night that we were storming the place at eight oclock and i told you we werent and we havent and even when you thought that somebody was on the roof i told you that we were not
and we didnt
okay now i agree with you on all of these things you know and i love america you know and youll find in my past record that you know im not a bad person in 1988 if you research that so called gun battle youll find out i went plenty of times to the sheriffs department and asked them to come out here and deal with george roden on that corpse abuse thing you know if you research that youll find that out and when i was told point blank that i had to get these pictures and as we were walking out sheriff dixon says now boys be careful you know there are some dangerous customers out there
oh look if i wanted to commit suicide i would have done it already now let me explain something
we were accused three times this last year of going to commit suicide three times the authorities were roused up by letters from martbro [phonetic_sp] and all that here we here weve been digging lakes in the front fixing this place up from a rat hill hoping that one day we might have this place finished to be able to present it true to all those who want to come but at the same time knowing that as long as there were people who would not look at the truth we could not sit with idle expectation and think that were always going to be able to to have this freedom that weve enjoyed weve never gone outside our boundaries weve done things that are legal you know always suspicion on every hand you know but the thing of it is is that if there is anything in question we need to take it to the bible christians are supposed to take it to the law and the testimony of gods scripture now otherwise we are commanded by scripture to abide by the laws of the land in every degree as long as those laws dont 100 percent conflict with the law of god in nebuchadnezzars day when nebuchadnezzar had that dream you know daniel and them were subject to the babylonian kingdom werent they they kept the laws of chaldea didnt they but when it came for nebuchadnezzar to make that image and he commanded all people to bow to it
and we want to get you out of there as soon as possible because you know your blood pressure isnt all that good youre not you know with all those blankets that you have on you you should be sweating a little bit and youre not
i understand that but your injury youve had that injury for some time now you need attention
you know there for a while you said your mind was going blank you know periodically i feel that you have a shortness of breath those are not good signs we need to get attention medical attention for you so i dont want this thing to drag out and and have your death on my hands i dont want that give me a chance to help you

he should have done a little bit more than probably that what he done

forget about them cause were talking right now
mr <ht1> you so have a win if you come out of there if you come out of there without any problems and nobody getting hurt thats a win thats a plus for everybody right are you with me [pause] mr <ht1> mr <ht1> [disconnect_1239_call_back]

well it i it depends on what im able to do with these bankers but i im wil
i am so nervous i have tried to drive and i cannot drive the car
i then i that is not fair hello
im not playing i got scared im i im not playing im doing exactly what you
in fact i got scared and left when the police drove up a minute ago i was
id like to talk to <ht01_first_name> there i need to talk to <ht01_first_name> cause we need to talk about these problems were having we need to uh be able to communicate together
its not a game were playing its just that we we have to go through all the uh agencies and and what not it takes time we cant do it right now but itll take time
question hes got to uh wanna come we couldnt force him if he didnt want to [pause] were contacting him now in an effort to see what his feelings are still with me <ht01_first_name>
well were going to get the hamburgers now but we <pn60_first_name> t know how were gonna get em out there cause <prisoner_last_name> isnt available right now
were working on it but were concerned for the safety of everybody involved here and we wed like to have some assurances of safety for our people out there
those girls are needed
how are they needed you got uh other people there that you control [pause] we gotta talk to a lot of people and they want to know how youre cooperating what what the story is and theyre concerned for the safety of the people out there
and theyre concerned for your safety also and they just theyre interested in in mr <prisoner_last_name> s safety also and
well i set forth some uh simple demands and if theyre met then everyone will be just fine and dandy but if youre gonna play games with me then things are gonna come down to uh something
were not playing games <ht01_first_name> were were trying to help everybody were just trying to help you as well as the people on the plane were not playing games with anybody dont believe me
<ht01_first_name> youve been at the university for a number of years you know uh educate you know what the what the story is when people start making decisions you gotta be reasonable in the matter were trying to be reasonable with you were interested in your safety and the safety of everybody concerned trying to help you and help the people and and get this matter cleared up without anybody getting hurt
dont you think <ch32_first_name> should make that call herself
yeah shes fine but the little girl may be a little bit apprehensive if her mother isnt there [pause] think itd be good if <ch32_first_name> could call uh herself on the phone talk with her daughter
10 4 uh we appreciate the uh way things are going and we will do what we can and work it out if <ht01_first_name> s there ask him about uh <ch32> s little girl i think maybe that <ch32_first_name> should call the little girl direct the child could be very much upset uh about her mother
uh <ht01_first_name> were very much concerned for of course everybodys safety and thats what our prime objective is safety and uh work things out from there by everybody i mean you as well as the passengers and crew [pause] ground control to <ht01_first_name>
we gotta know what your decisions are going to be in order to make our decisions i gotta look at the alternatives as as to whats going on what could happen and uh we dont want anybody hurt and uh including you <prisoner_last_name> the crew and the passengers
<ht01_first_name> you got all the trump cards uh were not gonna do anything uh just uh uh the girl will come out and pick it up and go right back in were gonna let her come back we wont interfere with her at all and or would attempt any uh thing funny were going to do play it straight
gotta take one step at a time <ht01_first_name> one step at a time lets lets go for just one step and then then well well talk about step two
uh force you were just trying to make this thing as easy on everybody as possible but we do feel that <ch32_first_name> with her little girl out in denver you heard her husband was killed in an accident that little child has just one parent and we want to get that girl out of there
come on now we got to change a little bit every day we have to change and and cooperate and show our cooperation uh before when we talked we didnt know <ch32_first_name> s husband was deceased we didnt know the little girl only had one parent that she is depending upon and uh the little girl needs her mother and certainly uh we want to help the little girl we want to help you we want to help everybody but right now we feel that thats the prime thing on the whole the whole thing is whether youre gonna cooperate with us in that one little request
were looking to you to for a good sign of a good gesture on your part something that will show cooperation on your part to show that uh you earnestly uh mean what you say
well we need an answer before before we can make a decision and uh its its essential for us in in our decision making uh that they know what your plans are what your alternatives are and what youre going to do uh thats very very important <ht01_first_name> so uh how bout giving me an answer on it cause you you certainly have uh plans and alternatives
were cooperating in every manner possible <ht01_first_name> were doing everything humanly possible uh to resolve this to the benefit of everybody concerned so nobody gets hurt thats the main thing we dont want anybody hurt
thats what were talking about so lets like i said before its imperative that you things going because uh im in a position where i really dont have anything to lose
people to die nobodys playing god uh youre youre youre causing a lot of hurt to a lot of people like uh <ch32_first_name> s little girl out in denver and <ch32_first_name> and the other stewardess there and and the passengers in the plane and their families thats causing hurt and uh i dont think you wanna do that
this is most important <ht01_first_name> and and uh i appreciate how you feel but i also appreciate how the passengers feel and how the pilot feels and and the crew there and and uh im concerned for them as well as for you uh i dont wanna see anybody hurt or anything i couldnt uh i dont like to see pain and suffering i like to see happiness and joy
uh <ht01_first_name> we cant uh be sure that were gonna have all of the answers by 500 uh lets not set a deadline on it l lets uh play it by ear and see how things go weve play tried to play it pretty straight with you havent and and its not going to resolve the matter weve got to find out primarily before we can get answers what your intentions are as far as what if <prisoner_last_name> fails goes with you what if he refuses to go with you
all right im not talking about the other air traffic controllers and these other people up here im talking about me and <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> now weve got different considerations than these other folks do obviously anything that you tell us is a matter of confidence between you and us i really wish that <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> had a chance to get down here i do need some time and i like ive told you all along <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> and i work on all these cases together you know uh in fairness to <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> i just wish that you could give us some time to get <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> here so that he can talk to you i know that right now you may not think that theres anything to be discussed but <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> may have some insight or some information that would be very helpful to you at this time
no <ht01_first_name> you gotta consider your parents your brothers and uh the people that uh love you and have faith in you and uh theyre thinking about you and and theyre worried about you and they want to see you you everything turn out well and uh you owe something to them too dont you
<ht01_first_name> as you can see were not uh trying to beat around the bush weve weve given it to you straight even your defense attorney gives it to you straight and before we were cut off i offered you the the if you wanted to see <prisoner_last_name> that uh just lay down your gun and walk out of the plane and uh well be glad to take you to <prisoner_last_name>

okay <ht01_first_name> now one thing they need and i think this is reasonable it you you tell me if you dont think so if i can get <prisoner_last_name> out here i need a show of good faith that youre that were dealing as man to man release the two women keep the men and the pilots but release the two women so ive got something to bargain with i cant just tell these guys to shove it i gotta have something to bargain with
<ht01_first_name> we gotta have a show of good faith on your part first i im raising hell to get him out to you theyre trying to raise the attorney general in washington let the girls go you got the men left thats honorable we talked about children awhile ago the girls got a four year old daughter shes a widow theres nobody else but her let her off and ill kick ass til i get something done okay
i know its escalated it really is escalated <ht01_first_name> thats why weve gotta have a show of faith to get something started we had something working on the other charges thats beside the point now forget about that weve got people out there and and <prisoners_middle_name> has gotta make his own decision weve got to get him out here <on81> and i have got to talk to him [pause] ive got to have something to bargain with <ht01_first_name> let me have the two women let em you dont need em let em go thats honorable then i got something to bargain with to get <prisoner_last_name> out here come back to me
<ht01_first_name> i can believe that but these people dont know you they dont know you at all theyve never seen you before i know youre youre an honorable man and that your words good but they dont and theyre telling me if im gonna be your representative ive got to have some show of good faith from you have that much confidence in me <ht01_first_name> to let the women go keep the men well get <prisoner_last_name> out here and talk some more think about it [pause] tell me what you think now
you dont lose your bargaining power by letting two people out of 13 go you still got the men there the captain and the co pilot nobodys gonna sacrifice them im just asking for a show of good faith by letting the women go then ive got something to raise hell about over here ive got something to prove youre an honorable man other than just my word for it [big_pause]
i understand you set a deadline <ht01_first_name> but remember see i was in washington in the department of justice with another client and i flew into the airport they picked me up with helicoptor and brought me over here so i got here just as quickly as i could ive got to have some time to get a grasp of this thing let these people who know who i am let em know ive got some balls and im dealing for you youve got to help me by giving me a show of good faith so theyll deal with me let us have the women let me call you back in just a minute to to theyll be no sweat nobodys gonna make a move im sure of that [radio_cutting_out] [pause] on this frequency [pause]
<prisoners_middle_name> s a little nervous as you can tell but what hes telling you is straight theres really nothing we can do on the airport weve got to do it in court im gonna be with you ill come out to the plane ive got their solemn promise and i theres an agent here that ive known personally for 15 years wouldnt lie to me not gonna be any funny business theyll let me come on the plane with you after you release the people and ill have one agent with me in the car and ive got judge <judge_last_name> standing by hes the judge that lowered your bond and theyre gonna take us directly to the courthouse before judge <judge_last_name> and im convinced and i wouldnt tell you this if i wasnt theyve done everything ive asked them to do so far im convinced theres not gonna be anything but lets go in and lets fight our court battle we cant fight it at the airport but we can fight it in court youve made your point <prisoners_middle_name> very much appreciates it nows the time to to put this aside and go on in see judge <judge_last_name> do the best we can do try to get <prisoners_middle_name> out on bond for at least awhile anyway before while theyre doing the police investigation and do what we have to do how do you feel about that
<ht01_first_name> this is <ht01s_lawyers_middle_name> what do you think were not hurrying you for the decision but <prisoners_middle_name> and i think that we can help you that youre going down the a deadend alley now and its not worth it so let me try to help you and you youve already helped <prisoners_middle_name> all you can let me try to help you now
<ht01s_first_name> dont commit suicide or anything like that go ahead and just uh surrender dont dont take off or anything like that uh i can i can you know do a stretch something like that and maybe a little space between our ourselves and reality might make us you know a little better but uh but uh this this is just futile you know theres nowhere to go and according to uh my knowledge of this plane it can only go back as far as uh island or in the opposite direction were gonna have to stop again and on down the road or something like that im saying that its not logical to do this or anything like that it was feasible you know well i can say you have you have my sympathies i admire what you do its very very manly very impressive and i appreciate your and your loyalty loyalty to me right now your life means more than just throwing it away it doesnt serve any purpose just to you know just to waste yourself like that you need a purpose and this is just it its futile [pause] youre not obligated to me or anything like that just think about yourself from here on in
okay uh everybody around here is breathing a sigh of relief so i i dont ive looked at some of their faces and they dont look like theyre gonna shoot you or anything like that have confidence and uh <ht01s_lawyers_last_name> <ht01s_lawyers_last_name> s all right <other_lawyer> hes hes okay most of these guys around here seem to be kind of honest and <ht01s_lawyers_last_name> s coming down and he he uh he i dont think hes gonna do anything see once you get out of it man we can talk you know youll have time to look things over and this this is you know uh uh just get out of it man its its not worth it you know dont dont waste yourself for me or for anybody else let the passengers go
in thinking about it uh i dont know how many passengers are on board but what about the one fbi agent that ive known for a long time and i have complete confidence in his name is <pn60> he and i can come to the front of the plane so you can see us nobody but the two of us hell stay in the car i will come and try to get the door open and the ladder down you come down and you and i will walk to the car and i will ride with you to the courthouse how bout that
hey <name> look at it this way youre on the edge of winning right now what about the other eleven kids
dont talk that way <name> please i aint risking my life to come out here because i want to see you die dont be rediculous please
you know more influential people now than you did when you were eighteen people that like you not people that are phonies
theyre not gonna try anything i told you so far theyve given me their word at least until i get there when i get out there i dont know what i can do but im gonna try my damnedest to save your ive more than anything
i cant believe that you would let <name> die knowing what you went through just to prove she was yours
you think about it how about on the positive side all the people that you made friends with good friends who really like you not because what <name> was or what <name> thinks
i mean shes eighteen years old shes a young girl give her a chance to live <name>
but thats no reason for her to die
yeah <name> told me you went through a lot with them but you went through a lot with <name> too that doesnt mean that you gotta take a life
all im saying is to let the girl go call the police call the ambulance youre gonna regret it youll regret what you did and its a very sad thing shes eighteen years old shes got no reason to die for any reason now matter what she did
well just keep your head level you havent talked to these people in nine years you dont need them <name>
<name> you should have a doctor in there for you you must be having a heart attack
well lay off the coffee thats no good coffees no good it gonna raise your pressure and keep your heart make your heart beat faster dont drink no more coffee let yourself calm down and drink water
you gotta understand now when im out here i have no authority and i only gotta do what they tell me to do
well im here now nobodys gonna do anything at this point wheres the kid is the kid in the house yet
well just relax i mean theyre only following what they think is right or they have to do wheres <name> whos <name> now your son
im looking for somebody thats in full authority here that can ensure me that there wont be any fire who were you talking to on the phone when i came here
im trying to get that <name> i have <name> dont forget we are strangers new here we dont know who you know go see this commander that commander you know this isnt <name> where one guy has the word
yes but <name> this is <place> this is not <name> where i got the full authority you know
no <name> believe me believe me thats not anybodys intention
but <name> is that a reason to do this
<name> if we wanted her dead we wouldnt have the ambulance sitting here for the last three hours
your keeping her alive you a doctor
and if she dies then its gonna be your fault
but shes not dying by our bullets shes dying by neglect right now
we are supposed to take your word after you shot the kid in the back huh
okay if you had a daughter and you see her making fucking love to a puerto rican and knew that she would be nothing but a baby machine what would you do go ahead now i wanna hear this answer
all right because youre not in my shoes
no one could ever see if my daughter used to be a fucking low life tramp
well do you know why probably because they were concerned that your daughter was laying there dying thats why
why would we want to shoot you to death if they wanna shot they can go down the range and shoot they dont have to shoot at you
all right our main concern is your daughter thats lying there and possibly dying as youre talking on the telephone
why dont you let us take her out now youre gonna keep this up until she dies is that what youre gonna do huh is that the kind of father you are
everytime she calls her mother a cunt she tells her mother to fuck herself and me too come on give me a break i didnt invest all this time into hear her a monster
but is that reason to shoot her <name> come on
youre letting her lay there suffering <name> you think she feels good right now
no im not here to have one with you <name> all right im here to talk to you to try and stop all this stuff before somebody gets hurt somebody else gets hurt all right we know your daughters hurt the thing is we dont know how bad shes hurt
you could have hit her in the kidney or something you know i mean you gotta agree with me on that point you know
okay that was the reason they tried to get into the house the only reason was because of the daughter
all right but shes laying there on the floor right and youre changing compresses and the only reason they tried to enter the house was because they dont want her to bleed to death all right and <name> youre not a doctor
no matter how many compresses or wet towels or ice packs you put on her all right the girl is laying on the floor with a bullet in her spine
well what good is that gonna do <name> i mean lets face it man come on what are you a magician
okay hang on <name> i was outside talking to <name> you know shes not an <name> shes gonna stick behind you a hundred and ten percent and shes all for you she had no idea that this was effecting you this way with the other kids she would have thrown the kid out on her own you know being a mother she tried holding the family together are you there
but <name> listen to me you know yourself okay this kid cannot hang on forever she might have internal injuries just talked to some paramedics outside that kid has got to get proper medical treatment <name> why go on and on with this youre not gonna get hurt
<name> the man im talking to her i dont even know his name i think its detective <name> or something like that the guy he seems to have control he doesnt have the full say or the final say but right now hes outside trying to negotiate something on your behalf and on behalf of <name> look im not gonna snow you <name> as a mother youre tearing her apart and heres a woman still saying ill stick by him
first of all dont even think that way because <name> nor i are nowheres near the house wherever youre at we are a block and a half away okay we are in some gentlemans home okay so <name> aint gonna see anything like that all right they have all to do to control <name> that wants to run to you <name> she wants to be with you she wants to be in there with you you see this is not an <name>
theres so many things that could be done and you know that you know that and you dont want your daughter to die that way <name>
<name> you got so much there <name> when i first went at you you were being jerked around by different women you first wife and then thats <name> right and now this woman is sticking by you
sure but we knew that <name> even you knew that this is not a situation <name> you said to me when you first called me today you said its the same situation as in <name> its nothing you have a women its not even close you have a woman out there thats begging and crying for your life to be with you and that nothing happens to you <name> in your heart you know that you cant compare this woman one bit with <name>
<name> she dont think she made any mistakes with you let me tell you something im very proud of <name> to tell me that im telling you shes telling not only to me were not in a little corner hiding and talking shes saying it in front of all my men from <name> all these gentlemen and people that are here from wherever im at in long island believe me when i tell you its a different sitaution it wasnt <name> making a jerk out of you this ladys begging for you
theyll find a place you know another thing i give you my word and ive never lied to you like you never lied to me <name> will be taken care of and so will <name> and so will <name> if you allow it
and <name> its so hard for me to believe that this is actually a repeat in one sense its a repeat but not on the other sense <name> what i see is a woman outside crying and carrying on for her man besides your daughter shes not just yelling <name> <name> shes looking for <name> to walk out there and put her arms around <name>
but that wasnt a reason to do that <name>
well <name> never lied to you did he <name>
keep that in your heart and whatever happens <name> im by you
but now we have more we have a wife she is crying saying how much she loves <name> i mean all yeah <name> nor anyone ever said what <name> is saying to you now and has been saying is that right <name> you cant compare that dont put that woman in that same place with my friend <name>
but <name> take that one word okay thats blowing on you so much and take all the good words the i love yous from <name> that gotta be worth twenty times <name> one word shes a kid <name> shes an irresponsible kid
all right how long does it take you to think about it i know you must be getting sick have you still got them chest pains thats no good for you we gotta get a doctor in there for you too you know
<name> i remember <name> i stuck through you on that one im gonna stick through you on this one
theres a man i think hed flip out you gotta do the right thing for his sake <name> today the right thing is to get yourself and <name> out of there in one piece see you cant only start thinking about <name> now you gotta think of people that like you and love you you gotta think of <name> you gotta think of father <name> you gotta think of me you gotta think of <name> and even little <name> because im still no matter how rotten of a kid you might think she be she still loves her daddy there were too many good years even though i dont know the whole story
that happens though <name> it could happen that way people have different funny ways of showing what they call love you know she eighteen years old wants to be on her own they grow up too fast these damn kids today you know its where we live how we live what we do who our friends are its a hard world out there <name> you know jeez im telling oyu and youre a guy thats knocked you head against the walls a hundred times
<name> no matter what happens you still have a way of turning that kids life around and <name> <name> i keep calling her that little <name> you still have a way of turning those kids lives around you might be sixty but youre still gonna live awhile you make me feel like an old man and <name> hes turning grayer by the minute here hes got more hair on me oh wait not much on the top though <name>
youre not drinking anymore coffee are you because one of the paramedics told me thats the worse thing for you to have now
heres what id do for you you come out to me and <name> and the third person youre gonna see would be your wife
okay but now the thing is we cant bring her over and stand in front of the house with you with all these guns and ammunition there i mean you gotta see out side <name>
but you know you asked me before you want you know i cant promise you this i cant promise you that i can almost tell you to a fact they are not gonna let your wife walk over to that house while you have all the weapons i mean that now <name> you gotta put yourself in our shoes you told me before put myself in your shoes with <name> i mean that would really look great in the headlines if something went wrong with that right
no not at this point its not no no because we have control of this situation we just cant allow it right now
you gotta make that decision and nobodys gonna harm you listen whatever happened on my way over here this guy <name> has it under control you know theres so many people you know what happens people get excited how about that day <name> <name> he threw a shot back at you when he shouldnt have this is the same thing that somebody here but its not gonna happen these gentlemen are well trained this <name> knows who his chain of command is that he has to go to nobody makes a decision without any and thats why this poor guy is running back and forth
listen <name> you know you and <name> it has to be a living hell for her with her own children i really would like to see the children grow up to be doctors and lawyers and good citizens
well you answered your own question and thats the words im looking to say that no mother wants to see her kids that way its gotta be heartbreaking for <name> and through all of this this woman is standing right by you
i cant its not a i dont have a portable phone right now im in a house shes about a half a block down from me
heres the thing all right now pay attention if you get her upset and she gets sicker and they have to take her to the hospital then youre not gonna be able to see her when you come out
theres a kid that replaced a son for you remember that the kids sincere i mean hes shooken up about it they all are
there you go so you lose one on one hand <name> and you gain another and sometimes its the ones you gain that have a stronger bond
yeah but you have a nephew that probably is equally
<name> and you can take that credit because when your brother passed away you stepped into you brothers shoes for <name> and that kid knows it im telling you hes out there bawling like a baby <name> when he was talking to you he was all emotion and choke up you know the scene here is changed <name> we are not a bunch of hard cops saying go get that guy we all feel we all get lumps in our throats we know whats going on out there so the men that are here on this negotiating theyre warm they feel close to you theyre feeling what youre feeling
i didnt realize it <name> i didnt realize it was this bad im gonna stick by you in years to come by youre gonna say she meant it she stuck by me i am going to stick by you every inch of the way <name> every inch i will be anywheres youre gonna be i will be there for you anytime you need me i will be there this isnt <name> talking <name> this is <name> and i have stuck by you my marriage vows said for better or for worse
remember one thing <name> ill stick by you ill stick ill be there when you need me ill be there i can we can work things out <name> believe me we can
she still needs your protection <name> she needs your protection to live and become a young lady and her futures in your hands just like <name> im just as concerned for her sister you do want <name> growing up
well nobodys been coning you <name> i gave you a promise theyre not gonna con you this fella <name> is a negotiator hes not the one thats gonna con you i think hes been pretty fair and straight wanna talk to him again
i told him that he knows that im sure <name> knows that when <name> <name> gives his word he means it are you convinced of that <name> a hundred percent dont think id be here okay what do you say you come out with <name> we get you a doctor
okay you got it time we have but i dont know if <name> does you and i have all the time
well <name> that could be a bad sign
but we dont know internally what
but shes not talking
okay so she knows shes hurt
well your wifes very concerned about you too you know
im trying to make things easy for you thats what im trying to do
<name> you know with all this while we are doing all this waiting okay she could really die while we are sitting here thinking about all this stuff
yeah but <name> sometimes you gotta try to overcome that i mean youre a long time dead once they put you in the hole thats the end of it i mean maybe youd be better off by yourself who knows
<name> all the time were talking shes laying there you know i mean i just dont want to forget that all right
shes outside on the porch here hoping that youll come out hoping everything will be all right crying her eyes out for you sticking behind you a hundred and ten percent
you know what <name> also told me she said <name> you wouldnt like your daughters moving out and living with a guy but what am i gonna do she said i have five children and i lost all but two she says for <name> and i would still stand by <name> i gotta believe her <name> this is not an <name> believe me keep that in you mind i told her the deal that youre thinking about
to what end youre gonna upset her
thats as simple as that my words good too i told you id talk to you after you let th
the police officers are outside but i want grant i promise you nobody is there to hurt you but can you listen to me for a second
okay we dont want to hurt you and i dont want you to hurt yourself okay grant

yeah i just saw them i mean you got to let them know that i still have this pistol to my chest and if anybody comes in ill shoot thats going to be it for sure
if you have to cry you cry okay if it makes you feel better i want you to cry because sometimes crying helps you know makes you think better nobody is going to come in okay but i want you to talk to me so we can help you this has been this has to end because i dont want you to hurt yourself but i need you to put down that gun if you put it down nobody is going to come in were going to talk to you okay can you put it down for me away from you because i dont want anything to happen to you
we are going to work up to that okay for you trust me and you know that my word is good okay
okay so what good is just killing yourself going to do
well if you stay alive you have a family you have
okay it is not illegal to have a gun in your hands grant the thing is is i want you to be okay if you kill yourself its going to upset your family its going to upset your friends its the day after christmas man and you know what theyre going to think about every christmas is going to go grant killed himself over the holidays all right dont ruin it for yourself and your friends okay it aint worth it man hey you know what chicks are dime a dozen okay you can find another one if you called her on the phone and it happens thats fine but i want you to be okay i want you to be safe and i dont want you to get hurt okay can you do that for me grant
well why not the cops arent going to hurt you believe me you leave the gun in the house
no no listen to me we will get you some help we will take you to the hospital well take you to some place that you can talk to somebody a doctor a professional not just a counselor okay thats what you need buddy and youll become fine believe me okay you are running through hardship with your girlfriend and with some other things and you know everybody else is having a tough time but its an easy way out and were not going to do that okay im here to help you grant i dont want to see you hurt yourself and hurt your family okay
okay well i dont want your dog to get hurt and i dont want you to get hurt so why dont you put the gun down and come outside okay we will get you some help i guarantee you you have my word okay i dont want anything bad to happen to you okay can you do that for me
i dont know i cant say but its better than the alternative isnt it
because we want to make sure that youre okay that youre not getting hurt
grant i cant guarantee you wont go to jail but lets talk about your life getting some care okay youve got some problem we can get you to the people that will take care of those problems okay if you shoot yourself like i said what thats going to cause [a] its going to upset your family its going to upset your friends all right and its going upset other people if you come outside leave the gun in the house then we can may get you some help well get you some professional not a counselor but some decent doctors
okay well i think she still cares about you you know and well maybe not as boyfriend girlfriend but she cares about you that you dont hurt yourself
well i dont know who called but if shes concerned about you then she wants to get together she still is concerned about you as a person okay it doesnt make a bloody difference who called right now the main thing is grant that we get you taken care of okay what kind of gun do you have
well i just want to have some information how old is your brother just give me his age
okay i can understand well like i said grant unfortunately or fortunately theres lot more women out there lot more girls and evidently whatever happens one way or another killing yourself isnt going to its not going to make things better its just going to make things worse you understand what im saying you got to think of your friends man christmas time you should think about your family and friends okay you still have friends in the area that went to el camino high school
okay and you need to understand because we dont want to hurt you we dont want you to hurt yourself we dont want you to hurt your friends we dont want to you to damage your parents house how long have you lived there in that house
okay well grant you got to think about those kinds of things look youve got a good job you got a nice truck and you got people that care about you you know what im saying itd be nice if you could come outside and well get you taken care of okay i guarantee you that do you smoke a cigarette or anything
no no no you wont be were going to take you to the hospital and well get you checked out with that kind of a deal but i cant say that you sometimes you may have been at vista but its not like youre going to be in there forever if you kill yourself thats forever done
you dont want to leave your parents with that memory you had a good christmas and the next day grant killed himself its not worth it mac its not worth it grant i want you to put the gun down come outside and talk to the officers okay
well heres the deal if she is the one that did call us and definitely she cares enough about you to call us to check on your welfare to make sure you dont hurt yourself is it not fair
well because they probably dont know about it you know how police stuff goes will not let anybody get close to the house you know what i mean
grant will you shut up for a second and listen to what im saying did i tell you were going to take you to vista no we are probably going to take you to tri city hospital or county middle health to get things worked out im not going to [explicit_language] you on that thats the truth and you know what is the truth you havent done anything wrong today okay
because there is somebody being held hostage somebody is injured were serving a we are here to check on your welfare your safety we want to get you out of the house without a weapon so nobody gets hurt we want no one to get hurt thats our goal we like you to come outside
so killing yourself is going to do some good
you dont but thats the easy way out what about your mother and father your brother your friends dont let them down whats that
well how upset are they going to be
and youre going to let all those people down like that
okay and whatever happens when you come out im sure theyre going to still love you but you need to be there so they can love you like i said like you got a pretty good job you got a nice car you got some people you got a family that cares about you okay how about your little brother whats he going to think if he doesnt have a big brother to help him with his life
yeah there is no relationship like a brother and brother you know that you may want to kick his arse sometimes but you know what hes your little brother i bet you take care of him and you know what he probably he looks up a lot to you you need to help your little brother and turn him into a real man and im not going to do anything silly he is probably the most important person you should take care of just like yourself he is your little brother and your mom and dad and if things dont work out between you and xxxxx hey like i said theres lots of women out there and you can find somebody i know its hard but it sounds like youve got your sweetheart since high school and believe me my heart was broken by my sweetheart at high school too okay whats your brothers name
okay if youre not there to do that who is going to be there to help him
well sometimes your parents are busy doing other things sometimes its good that a brother takes his younger brother out
okay whos going to take care of the dog if you are not there
so thats worth killing yourself over
what are your mom and dad going to say when they find out you killed yourself
yes i would imagine and then who is your little brother going to have to look up to
well dont you think it would be better if he looked up to you as an older brother
you need to take care of the little problems you have which are little they seem big and the big picture little nobody has been hurt and nobody is going to get hurt a lot of people depend on you okay not financially but a lot of people depend on you mentally physically and emotionally
your brother is going to need help hes going to need help growing up okay your mom and dad are going to need help too you know your dad did 20 years in the core and now he is still working hes going to retire soon and he is going to need your help and i can assure youve got a lot to live for and if you kill yourself youre just going to upset a lot of other people and thats not going to do any good grant why dont you to put that gun down and come outside
definitely they are not going to come in thats why we are asking you to come out dont you believe if we were going to come in we would have come in a long time ago
okay all right hey everybody has a little bit of an anger problem and how to control it okay the problem is that you are getting angry and pissed off with everybody okay and if you get upset and hurt yourself or shut yourself we dont want that to happen okay we could help you well make sure you get some good help okay we have an officer who is trained in the mental health thing hes got a nurse that rides with him hes working right now and i guarantee well make sure that you get in to see a good doctor tonight all right well get the help you need that you get the counseling and you could help alleviate with these problems okay we all have problems believe me we all got problems the good thing is you havent hurt yourself you havent hurt xxxxx you havent hurt anybody else and i dont want to see you hurting anybody like killing yourself or hurting yourself there are still many people out there they care about you okay and appreciate everything that you do and if it was xxxxx that called she called because she cares about you okay not to get you in trouble she cares about you
well i am not im on the phone with you okay if she is not going to pick up the phone theres not a lot we can do with that okay youve never hurt xxxxx before have you
okay what if she contacted you first we can take care of that thats a minor thing the thing is you havent hurt anybody nobody got killed and that kind of things and i dont want anymore of that kind of stuff to go on i dont want you to hurt yourself i dont want you to hurt anybody else its not worth it okay and your birthday is in a couple of days youre going to be 21 its legal to go out and get a drink you dont have to find someone to buy the beer for you or go to somebodys house you can go out with your friends youll have a good time think about that
what im telling you grant is theres a lot more to live for rather than killing yourself and dying okay remember your parents your kid brother and your friends they care about you and obviously xxxxx cares about you too i just got to know theyre trying to get hold of her i think shes talking to somebody on her phone or something like that they are trying to get a couple of breakthroughs
all i want you do is i want you to think about think about all the good things they guarantee the good things are going to outweigh those bad things million to one
its because i think as soon as i go outside i will have guns hold on me even if i dont walk out there if i go out with my hands clearly in the air naked i think that there is a dozen guns pointing at me the dozen would scream at me to get down on the ground theres dozen with their dogs barking and then even when they trust me i still think theyre going to take me to vista
okay ill tell you whats going to happen everything going to vista you know that you know how the rules are we have to make sure that youre not armed okay but we will not take you to vista well take you to get some help like i told you i have been telling you that and telling you that were going to take you to tri city hospital to get you the help that you need okay thats what its all about
i dont know i cant say yes you may end up in vista but again you may not okay the thing is there are no major new charges against you the violation of the restraining order all you need to do is show the page xxxxx contacted me weve been contacting and everything like that were not going to worry about that what were worried about is your health and your safety were worried about getting you out of the house safe get you the care you need so when your parents come back from skiing they know that youre okay you understand where im coming from grant
okay but youre right i mean you go outside there is going to be a couple of cops pointing guns at you they are going to try to get you down on your hands and knees and as long as you comply theyll come up and handcuff you all right and yes you may ride on the back of the police car or they may put you in an ambulance and well get you to one of the medical facilities thats it not to worry about that okay you want to ruin your parents many vacations you dont want to ruin your friends holidays i dont want to ruin your holidays okay
a lot i have no idea how many are there no way of telling ill tell you theres a lot okay theyre trying to protect you and your neighbors and the neighborhood a lot of people want to get home theyve been at work you come out of the house we want those people to come home
youre just going to be a coward and kill yourself
no you need to come outside of the house think about your parents think about your little brother think about friends they need you your parents need you okay and if things dont work out between you and xxxxx theres somebody else out there probably
we are not going to come in weve been waiting for you to come out
well when life gets tough you have to man up sometimes and pull your neck and take care of your problems
okay you dont have any good reasons i think you should come outside well get you the medical and clinical help that you need you got so much to live for man so much to live for you havent even started living youre only 20 years old tear it up everybody makes mistakes you maybe keep on moving forward will you do that for me
okay but obviously shes not hurt or anything no so like i said if you want us to run the call let her i ride a motorcycle and they got tickets and then told me to come here and talk to you if she did call that is sure she cares about but she doesnt want you see you hurt yourself okay that is why were here were here to protect to your safety guarantee your safety and the safety of everybody else in the neighborhood and your family okay yesterday was christmas you hurt yourself you dont want or kill yourself you dont want your parents to think of christmas every time you go oh yeah thats right brian killed himself the day after christmas you dont want that you wanted us to turn a day the day after christmas that was good that was a big starting getting help to himself he picks himself by the and went out and started getting help for himself to make himself a better person brian what is your last name

the entire leg you can almost twenty three of them you know you know all of them talking about even the ones that wasnt down for it at first now they tell me wed a went we didnt went this far its fucked all the way up you know you can take a hostage or what but they drink im trying to explain it to them but they wont listen to me so this is out of my hands i dont know what more can they accomplish
well im up here for you understand the light we gotta coordinate you can understand you know i was going on
look what are you gonna do now are you gonna kill her if we dont have that money by five after because we are scraping it as fast as we can but time is of the essence for us too
we dont instantly promote anybody in this organization thats just part of my job and id like to do it because thats the best shot for you
nobodys coming through anything weve done exactly what youve asked us to
well its your decision to make its not mine ive made mine im already committed
no no no i aint gonna do that now like i said im already committed and im gonna see this thing out and if you people wanna play it deaf dumb and blind then thats your business okay
shes the mother of two children
got a husband i imagine hello
well shes got a husband whos very anxious about her so i suggest just for openers that you get your ass on the stick and you do what i want you to do as i want you to do it
well either that or youll take me as a hostage and get another hostage me
okay well i still think that the best way to go you thinking about that
and youre gonna take a number of years off of her life is it really worth it
well there are only there are only two of them and and both of them are one of them is clear out at at mesquite at the substation out there and the other ones down at search lab at the substation the only place they use them i thought they had them right here in town but they dont itll take quite a while theyre both quite a ways away and we cant give you one but well consider giving you an automobile the one you that wanted originally the <name> automobile with the radios that you that you said
well you told me that before but now and i told you before that its gonna be difficult for you to get out of that back with that hostage now we dont want you running all over the countryside with this girl because shes scared enough
course you dont have my word on that thats all i can give you
i havent i havent mistreated her in any manner way shape or form
no no no okay you have tried sufficiently to get me to give up and i cant do that you know that and i know that
and you will not be hurt
is that is that worse than being dead
or having or having the or having the life of this young girl on your hands you dont wanna do that
thats your best i cant offer you a better deal
well i i just its the best deal i got to offer you
no once you get outta that bank with that girl we lose complete control of her life and everything else
now certainly you know policemen better than that we cant guarantee what any policemans gonna do out there because theyve been you know theyve been on this thing all day
now how can we no really you you know enough about human nature how are we gonna control that
and i dont want you to do it because there no point in having a human life on your hands on your conscience because that isnt gonna help any of us and its certainly not gonna help you get outta there is it
well now that may be true but youre still again i told you theres just no way that we can guarantee either of your safety once you get out of that bank once you take off in that car
not really because there are just too many people around and and i dont know what youre gonna do i really dont because now youve been cooped up in there all afternoon
and then both of you can live and both of you can live theres no sense in you killing her or you getting killed yourself
no we are not that expendable no that isnt true because theyre not gonna theyre not gonna precipitously just kill us just because we happen to be with you no that isnt true
and youre saying youre saying all right now dave were going to do this this and this but we want you to to you know in other words you know this is like commercialization its like well i paid 3 wholesale for this thing and you paid 2 wholesale for that thing and i want to sell this thing to you at more profit than what i want to get for yours i mean
what im what im saying is is that like today they were broadcasting all over tv and since the fbi is involved you know when they cut our lines but they started saying all kinds of things on the radio that was not true you know and the deal of it was [end_tape_13]
the truck will not move
not going to leave just going to sit there listen i guarantee no ones going to interfere nobodys getting out you can walk down and look for the stretcher youll verify its there if if you want to walk down the driveway a little ways and look i guarantee your safety
but its okay tell them to go look theyre safe
guaranteed safety
theres no gun
okay theres no gun
nobodys coming out of that thing and ive told them not to move
they know youre coming okay
everybody knows
just pick it up and go on back i guarantee 1 000 percent safe conduct
well now remember too that that this was probably stated before we got this previous arrangement going like i said before nobody wants to die now but heres the thing we cannot trust you people nobody that has really had any experience with the federal government can 100 percent trust the federal government because like even with yourself or with jim we see that you guys are not the boss you know and the thing of it is is that theres just too many voices and too much influence you know ive let me back up and say one thing ive been very pleased thus far at how you know jim and yourself have you know guaranteed that they havent come in and punched us out yet
okay we just we just dont want too many adults at once you know
just so you know its just safety
oh he says jim can you call a tv station and tell that were coming cause theyre giving yeah krld because theyre giving all sorts of misinformation i guess
what happened steve is those reporters are all behind three hours behind what happens
to hold the line open thats all
because i dont want no mistakes
okay now let me know what the reading is because if its starting to to go down were were going to have to work quick okay you know im going to get this tape to these radio stations no matter what im giving you my word that thats what im going to do and thats exactly what i want to do but i want to i want to see that you get the proper medical attention
theres too many people that are following you that you know they want to see the right thing done here
oh yeah cause hes leaving sure well youll be out with him in a few minutes
well hes youll see him shortly
can you tell cyrus thats its okay that he has a picture in his pocket cause hes afraid that you know he shouldnt have any pictures that
youre going to take it away from him
okay you tell him
because of davids blood pressure and stuff
okay let me tell you how were going to do it so everybodys just as safe and sound as possible
well they kind of wanted to be you know they all like you know what they think of him and everything they all wanted to kind of be with him
okay but but the the other wounded wanted to be with him you know and get all hospitalization and everything
i want to just say this that you know a lot of these people are still theyre scared stiff you know that
thats why theyre heres what they were hoping
well we we want you to stay in there and not be one of the four as a leader and to calm everyone
well he kind of because you know im his good friend and everything
he wanted he asked me if i wouldnt be one of them that would bring take him and i says id be id be happy
but we dont feel comfortable dealing with anybody but you if hes not there you know youre the
youre the leader and
we need you to kind of stay there david can go out i mean you can watch it and you stay there and facilitate
but he requested because you know theyre all crying to him he requested that they take him halfway and let him sit there with the children until the rest can come and then they want to walk together
theyre theyre jim you know you got to you know theyre scared
i mean they really are and in fact were trying to figure out we in fact originally we were trying to couple things and theyre all shaking here and saying no i want to be you know and
and thats why what youre suggesting i like it but can we do at least do the one thing then just at least leave him halfway until we can get the like the the wounded guys and all that because they should come out too right away but but i like the idea of you know him with the children i think thats a good idea because
it will show trust then you know that we have trust in you
and that its working out okay is is that just that part at least because i mean im looking at some of their eyes right now and you know theyre scared
yeah i guess hed like them all you know i mean because thats his real love so
or ill have an armored ambulance parked at the driveway okay and they can drop lay you gently on the road next to the armored ambulance and you can say have three children stay with you i dont want you to be alone but you can have three children stay with you then the four men the other children and the women will start walking slowly in a group together for support and we know you know so they feel good down toward the ambulance i mean im sorry down toward the buses and then well have the agents put pick up david put him on the ambulance the children will get on with david and the ambulance will slowly just follow the walking group okay
you know between you and me i mean wed wed like to do it as soon as we can for david
yeah its not coming just tell them this its got no gun on it its not coming in the driveway

and if you have any worry just know jims telling you the way the right way and im im theres no tricks okay
yeah well thats okay you know if his blood pressure holds thats why where we thats thats one of the reasons we want to move up the stretcher now and you know do some preliminary things
well because the message has got to be played at 130 see and it it lasts for an hour
and then after that you know everybodys going to start coming out were going to make those arrangements
well im just trying i dont want david to have to lay there any longer than you know until after the message is played
