HENRY: Okay. How about any vital organs? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: It doesn't seem as any vital organs have been damaged. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. Okay. You would recommend that he get medical attention, would you not? ",,,2,,,,1,,commitment: convince David as the nurse to get medical attention; authority: David more inclined to listen to his nurse,1,1
"JILLIAN: Well, just a minute please. David? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER: David. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"JILLIAN: David, I highly recommend medical attention. What (indiscernible). What would I say? He's asking me whether you need medical attention. (Unidentified male voices in background not discernible.) Yeah. Well, at the moment, we don't think it's necessary. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. What time exactly did you take the, the blood pressure? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: I've only just taken it about 3 minutes ago. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. And what is your name? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: My name is Jillian Matthew. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay, Jillian. If you would, see 85 over 40 is a little bit, you know, is a little bit of a concern. So I would like for you to take it like maybe in another half hour or so. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: Um-hum. All right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: Yes. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. May I speak to him? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
JILLIAN: All right. You -- like to speak to you. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: You're holding up, huh? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Yeah. But she said it was a miracle. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Yeah. Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I got to -- like I said, you know, you got a, got a strong will you got a strong will. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Um-hum. Well, that's real good. We're happy to hear that. I have a bit of a concern. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay? And the concern that I have is, you know, when these children are coming out they are all convinced that they're not going to see their, their mamas again or their daddies. Okay? Now you gave me your word -- ",,,,1,,,,,remember the deal; no suicide,1,1
"DAVID: Now wait a minute. Now you're making a statement, you're making a statement which is totally contrary to everything those children with reasoning powers have been taught. Scripturally you're denying what they themselves have sit and heard day by day. So I know point blank that, you know, you have not asked them in regards to whether they're going to see their parents again. Because the whole doctrine revolves around, you know, Isaiah 49 where it says I will save thy children referring to the covenants. And you know, they, they know all of these or at least are aware in conversational-wise children that age usually do not have a conscience to discern or understand, you know, the high points of doctrine or philosophy. But no, the thing of it is that, you know, every one of these mothers tell them well, I'll see you soon. So I don't know why you're saying that, Henry. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, I'm not, I'm not questioning, you know, your word. You know, I just -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Well, I mean how -- you know, by, by your statement it implies that you're just making a statement. But the question lies is did you really ask them? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, see, for example. One of the kids, you know, came out with a note that says that, that his name is Joshua and that he's 7 years old and, you know, it lists all the different people that, you know, I guess are relatives of -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Relatives. Correct. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And we've, and we asked, we asked Jim originally. We said look, Jim. Because we -- first of all, our children don't eat pork. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay? Now whether you all uphold that or not we, we cannot really guarantee that.  But come to find out instead of calling the -- because I understand it may take a day or two in some cases. But instead of calling the present closest relative, you all, you all have gone ahead and put them down at the social place. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know, and which, you know, like I say that's kind of really neither here nor there at this point in time. You know, I've trusted Jim. I, I would think that he would be smart enough not to consider these children, you know, worthy of a foster home or something like that. Because that would strictly violate the reasons why that, you know, most of these women and stuff would be coming out in the first place. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: I mean they don't want to be judged or considered that they're unworthy of motherhood. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Or you know, having their children, you know, because of an incident such as we're in at the present time. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I mean that's another thing of trust again. Because like I say, maybe that's what you're going to do. Maybe that's not what you're going to do. You know, we don't know as of yet. Like I say, you know, in my case I realize that, you know, I'll, I'll never see my children again, you know?  Because, you know, I understand through, through many, many observations and through much history research, you know, how the government works and stuff. Like I say, I will dance to the music that I, I have played to. You see what I'm saying? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. But the main thing is for me to stand up in front of my Father, my God, and to present a truth that he gave to me. Because there's one reality that's above all realities. And that is when the powers that control the universe, you know, when those other worlds and those other beings out way beyond, when they come and communicate to you, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: A lot of people have a very Elizabethan ideal of God. You understand? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: They think God's got a beard and wears a robe and, and not a very smart, you know, it's kind of old, you know, traditional old English or, you know. God is very high-tech.  God's got computer systems and technology above and beyond what this world's ever seen. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I know Harry, you see. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: In 1985 like I said I had a little visit when I was in Israel. I've always been a sincere guy like Randy will tell you, you know, if you ever interview Randy. He knows I used to always tell him as a kid that, you know, there's got to be a God. And all my life I've, I've had this calling, this, you know, these -- anyway.  But never mind. But the thing comes down to this. There's a test in latter days. And it's a test of human intelligence. And all that which is human that is not going to use its intelligence. I don't mean in regards to bureaucratic law. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see, remember that two individuals that are into bureaucratic control -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- can cause millions of people to go to war. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: A hothead like Hussein and a hothead like -- oh, my mind, let's see here.  The Cuban guy, Castro. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: See just their, their one decision can cause many men to go and lose their lives, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Right.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID:  Well, see you might call that a political thing.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Um-hum.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But it really it's, it's, politics is another form of religion. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see. It denies a deity, a sovereignty. But still it has its principles -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: -- its philosophies and its -- well, not theology. It's I guess humanology (sic). Its Utopianistic views. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. So the point that we finally come around to is this. If you were in Israel and you was confronted with, you know, something from beyond this world, something that, you know, confronted you and communicated with you and told you what you must do and showed you things such as you have never dreamed.  See I used to stutter all my life. I was a stutterer. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: I stammer all through school. Had a speech problem. You know? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But after that event, I never stuttered again. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But like I say, we have to, we have to realize that, that in today's world with such modern technology everywhere we, we have to look at old truths of the Bible -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- in a modern way. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And the modern way is, is computerized technology. Seven seals, what is it? You know, data program. In other words, what mind of man can be able to categorize all the testaments of the prophets and put it together into seven categories. See now that's technology. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And the thing of it is it's called wisdom. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And scripture teaches us that if we fail to be interested in this riddle, then the worlds that are beyond our world are going to destroy all those whose attitude have shown that they have not chosen to increase and grow in wisdom. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: See, the prophecies themselves may be allegorical. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: They may be just little stories. But nonetheless, it still is a test. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know, when you're, when you're a little kid and they send you to a psychiatrist don't they put, tell you to put these little blocks in this little block thing there? And you got to shape up, match up the sizes? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. Well, the same as this last revelation. We have such pious and powerful men in the world. Such power. Look at the Pontiff. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: You notice how powerful that religious man is? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I mean no one questions the, the history and origin of the papacy. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I mean it killed millions. The Jesuit priesthood for those who went against its infallible laws. The eucharist, the catechism. All the, all the thousands and thousands of newborn babes they found in the catacombs, you know, and under the, the chapels and stuff that they put in the lime pits. Of course, we always thought that the virgin and the priest never did anything, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Yeah, but we find out later that there evil things were being done under a cloak. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And Martin Luther rose up against it. And how did he overthrow that system? With truth. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: A Bible truth. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So today we, we have a truth, a Bible truth. But it's not going to overthrow just the papacy. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: It's going to, you know, bring all the world into a valley of decision. People are going to have to hear it. They're going to have to say to themselves well, you know, that's right. That is right. That is exactly what is being said in harmony. And that, that does agree. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Then they're going to wonder, well, I wonder who this guy really is? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Well, the thing of it is is that I'm going to let you in on a secret about Christ, okay? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Anyone that God chooses to place his power and spirit in no matter to what degree that spirit is all have the same spirit of the one and only living God. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So what I'm saying is I'm saying that the spirit of Elijah is no more different than the spirit of Moses or the spirit of Daniel or the spirit of Hosea. Because these men as men can do nothing of themselves. Because all of these prophets had the spirits of Christ. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So Christ did not come in person except he came in the person of his messengers. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And the power of heaven strengthened these men and enlightened these men and gave these men gifts of knowledge and understanding to speak in behalf of Christ. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Which is the true living God, the word of God. Otherwise, you know, you can't put 2 ounces of faith in man.  It's impossible. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So anyway. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. Let me get back to this tape. And what was, what was the question again? You was wanting, you was wanting to know something else. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, one of the things that, that we have a concern about, of course, is the kids. We're hoping and we're, we're certain that we want them to be reunited with their families. We can count on that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Yeah, well, we realize also, and I was discussing it with some of the people here that, that, you know, once we go out there's going to be, you know -- now we realize our butts are in trouble.  There is some extensive research that has to be done, you know. Someone is responsible for the deceasement (sic) of law enforcement officers. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know. I'm, I'm hopefully they say on the news that it shows clearly in regards to when the officers first approached it shows, you know, who fired first. Because I was standing right there in the door. And I know, you know, that no fire came from our side first. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see. But the thing of it is is that my only hope would be for that is that, is that those, those cameras actually were zooming in enough on that front door. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: To show just exactly. Of course, what I heard one guy comment was is that, you know, somebody saw somebody there with a firearm. And so once they saw the firearm that, that's a sign to go after it, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Isn't that, isn't that a ATF rule or law? I mean if, if you all walked into a place, and a guy's standing there with a gun, you know, I mean that's, that's what you got to do. You got to draw out, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Well --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So that's probably where our problem came from. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But you know, I had my head and part of my body sticking out that door. I was actually standing in the door there and I, I waved out. And that's probably all on film too. And says, you know, get out of here.  There's women and children. Let's talk. Let's go. Get out. You know so -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- you know I hope they -_,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, one of the things that concerned us was that one of the mothers said to one of the kids I'll see you on the other side.  So you know, we were, we just wanted to make sure -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Well, now remember too that, that this was probably stated before we got this previous arrangement going. Like I said before, nobody wants to die. Now but here's the thing.  We cannot trust you people. Nobody that has really had any experience with the federal government can 100 percent trust the federal government. Because like even with yourself or with Jim, we see that you guys are not the boss. You know, and the thing of it is is that there's just too many voices and too much influence. You know, I've -- let me back up and say one thing. I've been very pleased thus far at how, you know, Jim and yourself have, you know, guaranteed that they haven't come in and punched us out yet. ",1,,,,,,,,REASON: we do not want to die so we will not kill ourselves,1,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see. I'm -- I respect that very much. I, I appreciate that. You know, I thank God for that that, you know, under the circumstances that you have borne with me. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know. So this gives the confidence, you know. Because this is a great nation, America, and it should be, you know, more considerate and more intelligent in regards to these things. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. So now this gives me more liberty to entrust myself in the hands of this system, you know, for you guys to be able to help drive this situation out of the mud. You know, this is like a four-wheeling truck. And we're all in it and we're stuck. You know, and we all have to drive this thing out. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And that's what I'm saying. I'm saying if you guys play right we're going to play right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I do not believe that how this got started was right. But I was not going to, you know, allow after all the things have been said about me allow myself to just stand back and sit back and allow the system to come in and, you know, push, push me around. I can't do that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see, I cannot have the message of truth to be stifled that, that easy. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But you know, you guys, you and Jim have been very, very considerate, very kind. Not at all like, you know, the aftermath of -- there's, there's a BATF video out on you guys. It's called ""Breaking the Law in the Name of the Law."" ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I'm sure you've seen that. Of course, like I say, you know, it's, it's not meant to ultimately degradate you. But it's, it just simply shows that people are human, okay? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: On both sides. So anyway. I guess I've said enough. And no. You, you tell the children that, you know, we've been letting them out little by little to see what you all's reaction was going to be. Because they've been saying on the radio all the time that you all are fixing to hit us tonight.  You know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, no, we -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And Jim's been telling me that's not true. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: We've never had that plan. You know, we --",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So I've, I've been balancing it out on both sides. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Because like I say I have to stand in a position to where if you do hit us tonight -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: No. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: -- you're going to, you're going to be guilty of killing little children. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Exactly. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And the thing of it is is that that's why in the beginning I made it very plain -- I stood in the door there, you know. And that's not very fun with a bunch of professionals, you know, coming at you. And I tried to tell them, holler best I can let's talk about this. I tried to talk to Robert Gonzales first, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And you know. I saw him on news here. But I think it's very cheesy in his behalf, very, very cowardish (sic) to be staying out of the light now. Because he could have -- and you tell him this. He could have stopped all of this. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know, his conscience is probably eating him up. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So anyway. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Okay. I'm sorry. So -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: That's okay. I just want -- yeah, I just want to feel real good about this.  And I want to feel good that everybody is going to be coming out alive. ",,,,1,,,,,remember the deal,1,1
"DAVID:  Well, that's what we want.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Okay.  Including you.  ,,,,1,,,,,remember the deal,1,1
"DAVID:  Oh, I'm, I'm still here.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Okay.  Nobody's going to commit suicide.  ,,,,1,,,,,remember the deal,1,1
DAVID: No. I don't think anyone's going to commit suicide. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Nobody's going to be coming out with guns so that somebody can shoot at them. ,,,,1,,,,,remember the deal,1,1
DAVID: Nobody's going to be coming out playing John Wayne. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. Well -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I mean have -- I mean are we letting our children out? I mean, you know, are the children gone -- do the children look like they've been abused or neglected? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: No. No. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Okay. So do they act abnormal except the one child because it was born that way. It was -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: -- a medical misinterpretation. You know, the doctor didn't quite diagnose something right -_",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- and it affected the child. But are you happy with the children so far? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Yes. Yes. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Do they look like they're raised strange, abnormal? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: No. No. They look just fine. I just, you know, because of your concern and because everybody's concerned that and, and primarily your concern that you not be considered just another cult leader. You know, and because of the sincerity that you've expressed during our negotiations, you know, I believe in, in the things that you've said. I believe that when you've given me your word, you know, you've, you've stuck to your word. And I want to feel good about, about this situation. And I'm holding you to your word. ",,,,2,1,,,,consistenct: holding you to your word; lilking: sincerity (compliment),1,1
"DAVID: Well, just like Jim said that. And, and like I say in our past experience together we've seen it's been more shadowy on your side than it's been on mine. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: I understand. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: I mean I've kept -- just like the other night Jim told me not to deal with anybody else but him. And we made an -_,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: -- an agreement. And then, you know, another guy came along. And, and then all of a sudden da, da, da, da, da. You know, he -- we, we -- he was very forceful and very strong. And when someone's going to play forceful and strong to me, then I'm going to play forceful and strong back. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: That makes sense. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see, but if someone's going to sit down and say look, I'm willing to give you, you know, 50 percent of the chips, and I'll take 50 percent of the chips, and we'll play this card game fair. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Then you know, when the chips are all on your side then I'll, I'll fold up. You know, it's a fair game. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And that's, that's the way, that's the way I've always been. It's the way I've always taught the doctrine that was given to me. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And this is the way the truth has to be. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. One of the things that I, you know, that I had a concern about, and you don't have to give me the specifics on this. But you know, when we've talked about the number of children that are within the compound, we've never had a real good idea. And you don't need to tell me that. But I feel -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
