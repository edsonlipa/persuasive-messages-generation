"DAVID: Don't touch it. Don't touch it because it's, you know -- someone was touching the cord and it's jittery. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Oh, okay. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So that what I do is I, I always teach with questions. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So I, I teach my students I say now look, I can't save you, you know. I am not anything as far as you can see any different from what you can see, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: We are not to worship men. So I'll tell them look, this is a -- I'll make them read the revelation of who, who gave it to him, what reason. Then when I take them throughout the revelation, their eyes are seeing the book. Their mind is developing pictures so that when we get into the part of the seals they see very clearly the scripture teaches that none but the lamb can reveal these things. And I go now,wait. Right here the lamb reveals it. He reveals the first seal is a man on a white horse. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Now you know, what's so hard about understanding that? Apparently, it seems like he's going to war. Seems like Christ is not only a savior he's a destroyer. Conquering and conquering.  Except we can't speculate, can we? Of course, they agree with me. I says now we shouldn't add our opinions. Because we really don't know the details of this. I says look here at the second seal. They are given a great sword that they should kill one another.  I said now why, how does that reveal Jesus? You know, Christ doesn't teach to kill one another. You know, he teaches love and turn the cheek, doesn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So we can't speculate here. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So then when we get to chapter 10 after we begin to read throughout the seven seals the trumpets start in the seventh seal. My students are brought to the attention of very strange and weird symbols or omens which again speculation is not the facts. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Now we get to chapter 10 we see that sometime during the sixth trumpet John records and I saw another mighty angel sent from heaven, clothed with a cloud and as faded as it were the sun. You know, and his feet as pillars of fire.  Stood up on the earth and sea, had his little handbook opened. And he cries and a lion roareth. When he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Now again, we don't know what this is all about. All we know is that the only thunders we know about is in God's throne, the lightning, thunders and voices. We know when the lamb opens the first seal there is the first thunder. But it says John is told to seal those things and write them not. But John was told that the mighty angel swore by the God that created all things when there's time no longer this mystery of God will be finished. So see my students begin to think about those things. What is this mystery of the, the little book that's opened? What's this mystery of the, the revelation of Jesus Christ?  And of course the last chapter when we learn about the river of the water of life we know that Christ is the Lord God of the holy prophets. You know, Christ is the one who from the beginning of time spake into the prophets, because he is the word of God. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Made angel or he's the word of God made flesh. It depends on what the will of the Father really is. But the keynote is he promised, he says I sent my angel. And he says I come upwards with me. So then at that point, my students begin to realize that the coming of Christ has something to do with a message, a message that only he can reveal. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So then I ask them well, would you like to learn the seven seals. Now of course, they look at me real funny then, don't they? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Yeah, see once we get that established about the judgment that only the lamb can reveal these things. And when I ask them would you like me to show you the seals, I won't tell you but I'll show you, then they look at me real funny like well, hey, you can't show me these things. And I go well, that's right, I can't. But Christ can, right? Well, yeah. I says well, let me show you something here in chapter three of Revelation. It says these saith he that is holy. He hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth. I go what is that key? Of course they don't know. And I go let me show you. I tell them there's 150 Psalms that David of Ove (phonetic sp.) wrote the Psalms, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And Christ is the root and offspring of David, isn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: God promised David to Christ that one day God would sit on the throne of David in the flesh of Christ, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And that was fulfilled in Christ. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So then I began to take them to the 45th Psalm and I go now let's open this Psalm up, and let's look at what God's thinking about. When you come up here to my church, you'll see the Father sitting on the throne. And the reason why he wants to know who can reveal his thoughts is because he put his thoughts down in a book. He does this so that we can receive mercy and grace instead of wraths or unrighteousness which is not too righteous. So then the 45th Psalm begins to talk in behalf of God. Now I always emphasize at my students stop looking at me. They've got to look at God. They got to be in the spirit. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So then when this 45th Psalm starts saying my heart is inditing a good matter, you know, we're looking at the rock, right? We're looking at God whose got the book, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And we already know the first seal pertains to a man on a white horse, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So whose heart?  Is it David's heart or is it God's heart? Well, the scripture says David was a man after God's own heart. Not in the same magnitude, but nonetheless the same spirit of the future. Where the Son of God was to be made manifest God says his heart's inditing a good matter, he wants to talk about the things he has made. He's a creator, isn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Touching his king. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And his tongue is the pen of a ready writer. So it's written in the book, isn't it? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So that we find in Psalms 45 that he does write prosperously. He does have a bow. He does have a crown because of truth. Now that doesn't mean that when Christ comes he's going to come on a white horse with a bow and shoot people in the heart, in their heart with an arrow. But it does mean that there's a truth that must be made known. Because the real thing to emphasize in that 45th Psalm is when it says upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir. Now the question is who is that queen? Is she a literal girl, or is she a church? Nonetheless whether she's literal or spiritual, nonetheless love is literal. Whether we love Christ spiritually or whether we love him literally they're one in the same. Okay, now it says hearken, O daughter, and consider. Now whether we're a girl or not all of us who have eyes to see should consider in the 45th Psalm who God has revealed so that in Revelation 19 when the marriage lamb comes it's very clear in that chapter who that man on the white horse is. And it says that he has a name. Of course, in 19 it says behold, I saw a white horse, and he that sat upon him, had a crown, many crowns on his head. He takes those crowns off the leeches of the earth you'll find in other prophecies.  It says he has a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is The Word of God. Okay? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So the keynote is that we begin to learn that what the revelation is is it's a -- well, look. You know, you know in a movie, when they want to advertise a movie? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Uh-huh. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: They don't, they don't sit there and give you 15, 20 minutes of the movie, do they, with advertisement? What do they give you? A preview, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Exactly. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. So If the mystery of God, the seven thunders are the seven seals, if it is to be finished as God declared to the prophets then found in the prophecies are the seven seals. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And you'll find that in the first seal the truth there is about Christ destroying his enemies. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: And the only enemies he destroys are those who are against his truth. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: And that's regarding the marriage which unitifies (sic) humanity and divinity into one mind. Only God's thoughts are worth anything, you see? Man's thoughts are vanity. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

DAVID: But God's thoughts are eternal. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

DAVID: Right. Okie doke. Okay let me -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Now you -- because of, because of the way that you have revealed the seals and, and your understanding of the Biblical readings, I have to assume that everybody that's contained within there -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID:  There's two plans.  God always gives  two ways out.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Okay.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You see, God -- see, if you had a better, if you had a better understanding of the prophecies. For instance, in Isaiah where it says behold for the mountains of fear that brings good tidings. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: It's a sad story of Isaiah 52 and 53.,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Okay. But whereas in Nahum behold will the mountains -- it tells you a different story. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Not that the two prophecies do not harmonize. But God has a plan like in Ezekiel where God says that if I shall pronounce a blessing against a people, you know, because they've kept my laws, you know, then if they shall break my laws that the blessing that I pronounced against them I will take away. And if I also curse a nation than it shall be no more that I shall destroy. If it turned from its wicked ways, then will I also turn from my evil which I have proposed to do and will bless them. So Ezekiel tells us in 33rd chapter that, you know, God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: No pleasure. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So the thing of it is that like Paul says in Hebrews 6 he says that, that therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ he says, the doctrine of baptism and resurrection. You know, he's talking about the simple things. You know, the very first steps in Christianity. He says let's go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of these simple doctrines. You know, the basic things like Jesus loves me and he died for me, and I must be baptized. You know, we, we do that once, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: He says for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened if they shall fall away. In other words, don't progress with truth, you know. Peter says be established in the present truth which means if there's a present truth there must be a past truth. If, if there's like we might believe the message of Noah now, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

HENRY: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: But maybe they don't know that Christ like they should. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: You're right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So you offer them the seven seals, you know. And well, like 2,000 years ago, you know the Sanhedrin says to Christ we be not the sons born of fornication. Sure it's easy today to accept Christ as a virgin birth, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

HENRY: That's right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

HENRY: Really. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

"HENRY: Really. Well, I think that, that you're going to reveal the way to, you know, to safety for, for your people. You know and we're going to of course afford you the opportunity to make that tape.  Do you think you're going to be working on that very soon? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

You know, just so much stuff in the scripture people overlook about the mysterious ways. So back at Christ in his day he says regard ye amongst the heathen and wonder marvelously. For I will work a work in your days that you will not believe though it be told you. And then he talks about destroying the nations by discovering the foundation unto the neck.

And the truth is in the days of these kings, Daniel says, God's tolerance of the gentile nation's ruling over his people is over. God's going to gather back the hundred and four thousand. God's going to choose the Jews. Because the gentiles are going to do worse to a Messiah who comes, who comes to teach the truth than what the Jews did 2,000 years ago.

How long will you seek after leasing? He tells them, he says but you should know that God has separated him apart that is godly for Himself.  The Lord will hear when I call unto him.
