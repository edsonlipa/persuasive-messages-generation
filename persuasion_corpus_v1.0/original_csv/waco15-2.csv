"TAPE: I guess whatever Christ says those who hear will find very haunting. Therefore God is lest ye forever. Well, gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty? Is Christ the most mighty? With thy (indiscernible) thy majesty? I mean it seems like in Revelation all in heaven bowed before the lamb, did they not? That's a lot of glory. But I'll explain. Received power, honor, glory, riches, wisdom, kingdom, might. Oh, that's a lot of inheritance there.  Especially the gospel says I received all things my Father. Says (indiscernible) because of truth. So what could this truth be? Some truths in the Bible talks about riding a horse prosperously and its truth. Could it be revelations? Could it be the first seal? Maybe a truth about Christ? Maybe a truth about him being a king (indiscernible) crown. Could it be a truth about him having a horse riding conquering into conquerors?

You know, there's some here that are so scared to leave the building. And, and I want to show them that hey, I trust in you already. I says look, I walked down there and I came back. I already told them, I says look. We've been dealing with Jim all this time. But they're sitting there shaking. So we -- what we were going to do is just bring him, you know, halfway. Put him down with the children. And then I'm going to come back and say look, come out. And in fact, there's a lot of the women that have no problems, you know. So then when they see that he's still okay and everything, that's when we're going to bring the other wounded with and just bring them all to the gate. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

JIM: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"STEVE: And that's why what you're suggesting I like it. But can we do, at least do the one thing then? Just at least leave him halfway until we can get the like the, the wounded guys and all that? Because they should come out, too, right away. But, but I like the idea of, you know, him with the children. I think that's a good idea. Because -- ",1,,,,,,,,reasons to do it their way,1,0
"JIM: Oh, yeah. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"STEVE: -- it will show trust then, you know, that we have trust in you -- ",1,,,,,,,,build trust,1,0
JIM: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

"JIM: Well, David and you can, can, you know, agree with me. And then we can explain it to everyone and, and they can understand it.  And we appreciate their concern. And I'm -- what I'm, we're so concerned that it go smoothly we don't want any -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"STEVE: Okay, sure. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"JIM: Hey, just hang on. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
STEVE: I will. I am. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"TAPE: Hosea seems to say the word is that you're not high people there should be said. You're the sons of the living God. So (indiscernible) says in the gospel if he calls him God, (indiscernible) the laws not be broken.  Well, learning God's word and God's spirit, this is what makes us become born again. Born by the spirit, acknowledging God. Well, so, so a girl believes in God. So does everybody else that believes in God. So therefore God the Father has many children, doesn't he?  Christ being the firstborn and thereon, everything, all thereafter did believe. But instead of my father should be my children. And thou mayest make princes in all the earth. To the person that doesn't really understand scripture, this would seem to be a very controversial subject. I mean Christ never had any wife. Has to be spiritual. I will make thy name remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever. Well, even if it is spiritual we know one thing. We, the servants of God, know that Psalm 45 is the very prophecy which must be hereafter according to the first seal. But just to make sure we know it's going to be fulfilled, let's turn in our Bibles to Revelation 19 just so we can get a better caption of what we are really looking at. Now remember, in the 18th chapter of Revelation, we know that Babylon the great fall. She made all nations drink of some kind of wine of the wrath of her fornication. Now we find that something very bad happened. And at verse 23 of chapter 18, no more light of a candle shall shine there nor the voice of the bridegroom or the voice of the bride. Well, the merchants were the great men of the earth it says in verse 23. And for their, by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. We all know about capitalization. We know about advertisement, selling something, making it better than what it really is. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. You see, just because people don't accept the truth in God's word does not mean it's not true. There's some truth that we might teach could get us in trouble. But anyway, the first chapter 19 it says and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in the heaven, saying, alleluia, Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power to the Lord our God. Why? For true and righteous are his judgments. I wonder (indiscernible). (Tape continues playing.) ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

And we know, you know, so they feel good, down toward the ambulance. I mean -- I'm sorry. Down toward the buses. And then we'll have the agents put, pick up David, put him on the ambulance.
