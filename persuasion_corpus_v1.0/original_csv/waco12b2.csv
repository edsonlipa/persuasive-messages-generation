HENRY: How are you doing? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: I'm getting this thing ready here. We've been having some difficulty with the main board. We got a Toshiba and TAS (phonetic sp.) cam, a studio series 2416 and it's, it's kind of like it's been kind of a wild wiring process here. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Because you know, we don't put this equipment where we're at right now. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"HENRY:  Okay, good.  I wanted to bring you up to date.  And what we've done is we've contacted KRLD.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Right. I've been kind of halfway listening to it turned way down but -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. And as soon as we get the tape, we're going to have KRLD play it, okay? In addition to them, the National Christian Broadcasting Network is going to play it. Now the, the thing that I want to tell you about that is they're going to play it from 10 o'clock to 3 o'clock, you know, more than once, several times.  But, you know, that's Phoenix time.  So we're talking about 11 o'clock there, you know, before we, before we get it here. But we're going to give it to KRLD as soon as we get it. And that's going to go over, you know, their network, and I'm sure other people are going to start picking it up. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. Let me, let me see now. So when, when -- it's going to first be played at KRLD? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So that's local. But it's going to be at what time at night? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: No. I mean if you want it played more than once, well, you know. Once they play it once they're going to -- everybody's going to be picking it up and it's going, it's going to be played, you know, time and time again. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Okay. But, but the question is is that, okay, KRLD's going to play it first. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Yes. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Just because of local curiosity, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, not because of local curiosity.  Because you asked it, I mean you told me that -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Exactly. I understand. But -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- but when is -- what time are they going to play it? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: As soon as you give it to me. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Oh, I see. Okay. But of course it's real, it's real late now. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, no -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID:  Okay, but that's all right anyway.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY:  I mean, you know, like --  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID:  Because they'll probably play it more than once.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Like, like if we get it at, at 5 o'clock, whatever, they'll start playing it then. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Right.,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: And they'll continue playing it, you realize that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: Okay.,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay, and then --",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But when is, when is the national going to play it? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, they told us that they will play it from 10 o'clock to 3 o'clock. But that's -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: In the morning. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Huh? Yes. But that's, that's in, that's Arizona time which means it will be 11 o'clock here when, you know, when you start -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID:  Eleven to --  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY:  Until, until 4.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID:  Right. Okay. Okay.  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Now how are you feeling?  ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID:  Like I said it's, you know, I'm weak but still I feel better. I mean, you know, I mean physically, yes. But you know, spiritually I feel a lot better. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. Well, I have a concern about your health. And I've been talking to some of our medical people. Okay? And I don't have any -- I don't have a real good idea, and I'm sure you don't right now. Because, you know, because you're like you told me you've got like a sponge or a thing, you know, and then the pillow or whatever. But you know, I don't know how much blood you've lost and you, you know.  Of course you told me that when you cough -- ",,,,,,1,,,time is running out; you're gonna bleed out,1,1
"DAVID: People, people were saying that, they were saying that they didn't think because I was talking so strong and all of that for a while that, that I'd actually been shot. But then tonight on the news one of the SWAT team officers said that he was the one that shot me. He, he shot me twice. So that confirms it. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Well --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: I mean I -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: The --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: -- I was just, I was just looking out the, you know -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: The, the concern that I have -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: -- the way there but -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Yeah. The concern that I have is I don't know, you know, I don't know how much permanent damage is, you know, the, the wound is causing. And the fact that you're not getting medical attention. ",,,,,,1,,,time is running out; you're gonna bleed out,1,1
"DAVID: Well, look. What's the foundation of religion? What's man afraid of above anything in the world? What's man afraid of by nature? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Death. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Death. Exactly. Okay? So the scripture says in Hebrews that Christ died and rose from the grave so that he would have power over him that had power over dead which was the devil and redeem them who through their lives were afraid of death and therefore subject to bondage. See, some people in religion I mean like the Jews back in those days, they were so afraid of dying and being punished of God that they didn't really see the real meaning of the law. The law was a revelation of a divine nature. And they didn't understand the prophets how the law was to be properly interpreted.  They didn't really look to the animal sacrifices for what it really meant. You know, killing a lamb is really a dramatic thing. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know, it's sad something innocent has to die. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Because you did something wrong.  But the, but the main key goes way back to Cain and Abel. You know, Cain didn't want to kill the lamb, did he? No, he wanted to bring his own fruits, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But when God blessed Abel and didn't bless Cain, Cain could kill his brother, couldn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: So you see this story repeats itself. So those who do what God wishes, you see, according to God's word, they're like Abels. And those who do not do God's wishes, well then they're like Cains. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: So now the question right now between us and you guys was which one was the Cain and which one was the Abel? ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Well --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: You know. Or maybe we were both one and the same. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. Well -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
DAVID: But --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: The one concern that I have is, you know, you've put a lot of time and a lot of effort into your cause, okay? And we feel that it's important to you and to the, to your followers to get this message out. Okay? And I don't want -- I have a concern that, that you may be getting weaker or whatever, and you haven't finished your tape. I want you to concentrate on working on that tape. But -- ",,,,,,1,,,time is running out; you're gonna bleed out,1,1
DAVID: I will -_,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: -- let me ask you this. And -- when I was talking to one of the ladies there earlier, she indicated that there's some nurses in there that may be, you know, kind of looking out after you. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Well, they've been like changing these -- we've been using like sheets. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: Off a bed and wrapping it around, tied it up, and then it gets wet. So then we -- if I lay still for a while and if I don't laugh I mean this is not funny like I'd be laughing but -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: You know, sometimes you laugh for nothing better else to do. But if I don't laugh and if I don't cough, then it stops bleeding. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID: But if I move a certain way or laugh or especially cough, then boy it starts coming out again. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. Well, we're concerned about an infection, and we're concerned about you going into shock. You know, now I want you to go ahead and finish your tape. ",,,,,,1,,,time is running out; you're gonna bleed out,1,1
DAVID: I'm working on it. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Additionally, you know, does anybody in there have a, a blood pressure cup that they can take your blood pressure? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID:  Oh, yeah.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY:  You, you have one?  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"DAVID:  Oh, yeah.  We've got, we've got --  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
