MR. KORESH: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

MR. KORESH: Well -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

"MR. KORESH: This is why, this is why you agreed to play this tape, right? Because you really have no intention of playing it, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: No, no, no, no, no. That has nothing to do with anything. If I told you that I was going to do something, that's exactly what I'm going to do. You know, I, I have no problems doing, you know, this and whatever, you know -- ",1,,,,,,,,self consistency,1,0
MR. KORESH: I told these people to trust you all. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: And, you know, and likewise I've been trusting you, okay? ",1,,,,,,,,we're trusting each other,1,0
"MR. KORESH: Okay. Now, here's the deal, though. You know, you do understand the importance to us for this -- what I have to say to be gotten out.  Now, we're not terrorists.  I mean, you're not -- And we don't have no hostages here. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: I understand. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: I mean, the children, that's kind of like a hostage 'cause, like I say, they're too young to make their decisions. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And I don't, I don't agree with that, even if they're my own, see. So the thing of it is is that, like I say, I've been faithfully sending them out. Not just because I'm trying to, to, to buy time, but because I just don't want them involved in this. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: You know? And trying to, to walk the middle of the road to make it as fair for us, you know, and as fair for you. But, actually, on my side, I'm going to make it fair for me first. Just like your, your side, you're going to make it fair for you first. So, you see, we both know where we're coming from on that area. You've got me, okay? Like you say, you know, we're sitting here listening to the radio and everyone on the radio keeps continually saying you all are going to storm us, you all sent, you sent -- You know, this is what they're saying now.  I'm not saying that that's true. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: See? So you're being -- If you're honest and you're being dirty dealt with, just like I have been dirty dealt with, you see?  And it's a different situation, but still it's the same thing. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Well --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: They're saying that you're going to do something and it's going on national radio, state radio at least, and people are out there listening and you're not correcting it, you know. And they're saying well, the fog is a good cover and this is going to happen and, and we've seen these many vehicles and they're moving up and, and, you know -- Well, you're not, you're not getting on those boys saying now, wait a minute, you know, we're not doing that. No, they're, they're incessantly tormenting us, you know, and they're telling us what you guys are doing. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Exactly. But one of the things that we've been doing is we've been ignoring the press because we don't want the press to know what we are or are not doing, you know, and that's why we haven't said anything one way or the other. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: All right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: That's why the press doesn't have the correct story, because we're just -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: But the press -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: -- not talking to them. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: The press, you know, you all pulled them back because, you know, they feel that when you all come in here and, and bang us all up and everything that you don't want them to get it on footage. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: But the press was saying last night that we were storming the place at eight o'clock, and I told you we weren't, and we haven't. And even when you thought that somebody was on the roof, I told you that we were not. ",1,,,,,,,,self consistency,1,0
"MR. KORESH: Yeah, that's true. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: And we didn't. ,1,,,,,,,,self consistency,1,0
"MR. KORESH: And that's in your favor, I agree. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay. So, you know, I would like for you, you know, in order for me to, to, to be able to, to sell all of this to my bosses, I need a little bit of help from you. Now, what I can do, or what I'd like to do is let me talk to them in terms of selling this to KRLD and maybe we can have KRLD then go national during prime time. And if we do that, will you agree to come out at that time? ",,,2,,,,1,,commitment: tape on air for hostages' authority: the bosses need some action from us,1,1
MR. KORESH: When you've done the national. ,,,,1,,,,,the agreement was for national tape playing,1,1
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: You can do KRLD and I'll still send the children. ,,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: You know. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: All of them? ,,,1,,,,,,all of them for the local radio station broadcast?,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Not all of them yet. Like I say, when you go national, then they'll all come, all of us come. ",,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
HENRY: Okay. Let's do this. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: That, that's the agreement we originally made. ",,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
"HENRY: Okay. And that's fine, but, but let's consider doing one, one thing. Supposing we do this. When the -- you send out the two kids to -- with the tape, give me two kids and two women. How about that? ",,,1,,,,,,send kids oout now,1,1
"MR. KORESH: See, there we're -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, I'm just saying I've got to sell this because -- ",,,,,,,1,,sell this to bosses,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Look, look, there's one thing that binds us all here together. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: It's the truth I'm sending in that tape. Now, these women, if they were to come out to you right now, you know, knowing how so far we've been dealt with -- We've been dealt with straight across the table, but there is some shadow there.  You know, they're not going to trust you until you have ultimately shown beyond a shadow of a doubt, you know, that you have kept your full end of the bargain. So, you know, it's, it's like, it's like -- What you're asking me to do is you're asking me to use my influence -- ",,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: -- to barter someone else's decision to deal with the effects of what we have believed in, because you all fail to understand what we're believing in. The Constitution -- Watch the baby, please -- in, in written form, though there's many interpretations, constitutional law says that we are to have religious -- freedom for religion.  But, of course, it has quotas to where we've got to define what religion is and is not acceptable. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Okay? Now, we do condone a Bible religion, but then there comes in the aspect of interpretation. So someone's interpretation could be wrong and therefore making their religion wrong. And if that religion hurts others, if it confines others or binds others, then definitely we have to take a stand and present it to the public so that the public, which is our judicial system, realistically, can decide that well, no, this is incorrect, and we have to, in means, deal with the person that's going contrary to, to what the person is saying the scripture says. You know, people can screw things up. And that religion is a false religion, for sure. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Okay. Now, I agree with you on all of these things, you know, and I love America, you know. And you'll find in my past record that, you know, I'm not a bad person. In 1988, if you research that so-called gun battle, you'll find out I went plenty of times to the Sheriff's Department and asked them to come out here and deal with George Roden on that corpse abuse thing. You know, if you research that, you'll find that out. And when I was told point-blank that I had to get these pictures, and, as we were walking out Sheriff Dixon says now, boys, be careful, you know, there are some dangerous customers out there. ",1,,,,,,,,persuade Henry that David is not a bad person (REASON),1,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, that's when I had to stop and think now, what does he know that I don't know? I didn't know Donny Joe Harvey or Orville Wells yet. I didn't know that George was involved in coke and also in methamphetamine. I didn't know those things then. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So, you know, why the system did not -- Well, like I say, this is a lot of water under a bridge. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But it did make me look bad.  And the thing of it was was that the weapons that we purchased, which you can look on all the yellow sheets, at that time everything we had was with a yellow sheet. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Everything we bought was with a yellow sheet.  Everything. You'll find that those things were bought locally and also in from Palestine. There were basic Rugers, you know, and stuff, which at that time was considered, you know, a rodent gun, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Of course, we know that the 5.56 is also a military, too. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But, anyway, the thing of it is is that it gets blown out of proportion. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Right. And I think one of the things that we're talking about and what we're trying to resolve here is, is that everybody's either fears or concerns about what might or might not happen. I, I think that what your concern is, your main concern is that we might attack you, okay? And -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Well, if you attack us, it just comes down to this. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Okay, but we're not -- We have no intentions of doing that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: I know, but it just comes down to this, though.  You end up killing us.  ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY:  Okay.  And our concern is that,  that -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And then you'll have a story the way you had it. You'll -- There's no, there's no media around us. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, we don't -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: You'll say that we attacked you and this, that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: No. Our concern is that you're not going to come out and that you might commit suicide. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Oh, look, if I wanted to commit suicide, I would have done it already. Now, let me explain something. ",1,,,,,,,,persuade Henry that they won't commit suicide (REASON),1,0
HENRY: Well --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: We were accused three times this last year of going to commit suicide. Three times. The authorities were roused up by letters from MARTBRO (phonetic sp.) and all that. Here we, here we've been digging lakes in the front, fixing this place up from a rat hill, hoping that one day we might have this place finished, to be able to present it true to all those who want to come. But at the same time, knowing that as long as there were people who would not look at the truth, we could not sit with idle expectation and think that we're always going to be able to, to have this freedom that we've enjoyed. We've never gone outside our boundaries. We've done things that are legal. You know, always suspicion on every hand, you know, but the thing of it is is that if there is anything in question, we need to take it to the Bible. Christians are supposed to take it to the law and the testimony of God's scripture. Now, otherwise, we are commanded by scripture to abide by the laws of the land in every degree, as long as those laws don't 100 percent conflict with the law of God. In Nebuchadnezzar's day, when Nebuchadnezzar had that dream, you know, Daniel and them were subject to the Babylonian kingdom, weren't they? They kept the laws of Chaldea, didn't they? But when it came for Nebuchadnezzar to make that image and he commanded all people to bow to it -- ",1,,,,,,,,persuade Henry that they won't commit suicide (REASON),1,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: -- you know, (indiscernible) we will not be careful in answering this to you, king, we will not bow down to your law which goes against our God's law. Well, the acid test came. They threw those boys in the fire, didn't they? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But who protected them? God did. Now, we're in the fire now. Not a real fire. And, like I say, we believe that America is a great nation and that it, like Assyria or Nineva of old, can hear the message of Jonah and it can have a chance to say hey, you know, this, this -- what this guy's teaching out of the book is straight out of the Bible, it's in harmony, it's perfect. Maybe there's been a misunderstanding here. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, what -- If we can go back and clarify our agreement so that you feel comfortable -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: -- and everybody feels comfortable. And what it comes down to is real trust, you know, and we need to -- you need to have trust in us and we need to have trust in you. Can you give me either all of the children or two children and two women? And, you know, and we'll give what I said. I will give you the KRLD and then going to national media right thereafter. ",1,,2,,,,,,other: we need to have trust (REASON); commitment: will you send out people for KRLD,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Let me, let me talk about this with, with some -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: You know, if we don't do what we say that we're going to do, the women will be able to give testimony against us. Are we going to look good -- ",,,,,,,,1,public will disapprove if we screw you over,1,1

HENRY: -- in the eyes of everybody? ,,,,,,,,1,public will disapprove if we screw you over,1,1
MR. KORESH: Come on. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: We will look awful. ,,,,,,,,1,public will disapprove if we screw you over,1,1
MR. KORESH: Look -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0

HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: -- how many times has the federal government -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: I have not -- I have been straight with you, with -- in everything that we've talked about. I've been straight with you all the way. I told you we would keep everybody away from, from the place, and we have. You know, we offered you gasoline when you didn't have gasoline. ",,1,,,,,,,we did you a favor; now you owe us,1,1
"MR. KORESH: I'm just thinking about all the past cases of where the -- Like I say, we both know what I'm talking about. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Whatever past cases I've had -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But this is our case, this is our case. Me and you are talking and -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Exactly. Exactly. This is you and me --,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: -- and, and -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: So you're worried about me committing suicide. All right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: We don't want anybody committing suicide. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: And we want to get you out of there as soon as possible because, you know, your blood pressure isn't all that good. You're not, you know, with all those blankets that you have on you, you should be sweating a little bit, and you're not. ",1,,,,,,,,you need help (REASON),1,0
"MR. KORESH: Well, how cold is it in this room? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: I understand that. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: Low forties. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: I understand that, but your injury -_you've had that injury for some time now. You need attention. ",1,,,,,,,,you need help (REASON),1,0
MR. KORESH: Yeah. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: You know, there for a while you said your mind was going blank, you know. Periodically, I feel that you have a shortness of breath. Those are not good signs. We need to get attention, medical attention for you. So I don't want this thing to drag out and, and have your death on my hands. I don't want that. Give me a chance to help you. ",1,,,,,,,,you need help (REASON),1,0
MR. KORESH: Well -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Give me a chance to help everybody. ,1,,,,,,,,help you and everyone (REASON),1,0
MR. KORESH: -- that's what we were working out. Now you're twisting up again. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: No, I'm not. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: You said that we would play this thing on national. ,,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
HENRY: We will. And that's exact -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: And I told you -- ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: That's exactly what we're going to do. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And then we would, you know, all come out. And I told you, I said well, look, I'll go ahead and I'll send a tape and I'll send you out two more children, and you said that's fine. And then you said we'll play it on KRLD and you didn't say anything about we'll play it on, play it on KRLD and then we'll send everybody out. You didn't say that. And so, you know, now you're saying something different.  Now, that's honest, Henry, that's honestly what's happening.   And then you're doing the same thing that, that Jim's doing. You're saying your bosses, your bosses. I mean, I mean, this is not Burger King management here, you know. You're the negotiator, you're the one's that got a lot of, a lot of power, don't you? ",,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
"HENRY: Well, I don't have as much, you know, I don't have all the power. I still have bosses. Okay, now, you're in charge there and it's quite easy for you to make the decision if you choose to do so.  Now, I've been real straight with you and I've pushed real hard for a lot of the things that you've wanted, and I will continue to do that. But I need a little bit of help from you. ",,2,,,,,1,,reciprocity: I pushed hard for you and now I need your help; authority: I have to answer to my bosses,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Okay, let me, like I said -- Finishing this tape is being dragged out now, too, so --",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: -- let me -- I'll have to, I'll have to get with these, you know, especially some of these girls and talk to them. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. Can I get two kids now? ,,,1,,,,,,can I get kids now,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Well, as soon as I get my tape finished. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: How about now, while you're still working on it? ",,,1,,,,,,can I get kids now,1,1
"MR. KORESH: Well, that's not what we agreed on. ",,,,1,,,,,remember our deal,1,1
"HENRY: I'm not, you know, I'm just asking you if you will consider doing that. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: See, you're making it complicated 'cause, like I say, are we going to send some mothers out with these children? Now, that's going to take some work on my part. ",1,,,,,,,,can't do it now cause I have to talk to the mothers (REASON),1,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: You know? And, like I say, these people know the seals and they know that unless this country observes and sees, then they know point-blank what's going to happen according to the prophecies. That's why our main burden is holding out here until we have an opportunity to state our cause. You know, what did Nicodemus say?  He says did our law judge any many before the hearing? We're talking about the Jewish law, which is law of God. Now, we know the law of man does, but, you know, that's where me and you, we kind of, kind of have a little friction, because I want to serve your laws where they coincide with God's laws. And America does. Above all of the nations. It does. You know, it's the closest to God's laws, basic principles of common sense, you know. But, again, there are some laws in the scriptures of truth which are the laws of prophecy, you know, and these laws are great laws because they're additional to the Ten Commandment law, such as the law of forgive them father, they don't know what they do. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: See, now, that's a law.  You have to forgive people based on their ignorance. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, the next law, which let's say the Ten Commandments is Christ, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So the 11th commandment is forgive them, okay? So every man that, that does err, we have to forgive him 'cause they don't know what they're doing. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So then the 12th law will be into they hand I commit my spirit, which means, like Isaiah 51 says, when God says hearken to me, you who seek after righteousness, you who seek the Lord, look to the rock (indiscernible) You know, God is that rock on that throne, isn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And it says behold my people, give ear to me, oh, my nation, for a law shall proceed from me and I will make my judgment to rest for a light to the people. And in that judgment, that law is Christ coming, the seventh seal. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, that's why without you knowing where these seven seals are in the Bible, you know, you wouldn't know how to judge me. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Exactly. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Except by your law. And I respect that. See, I'm willing to come out and be observed and judged by your -- ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

MR. KORESH: Okay. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: -- what the decision is.  In the meantime, you're also going to be working on the preamble and the tape. ",,,1,,,,,,"if I call you back, you give me an answer on the kids",1,1
