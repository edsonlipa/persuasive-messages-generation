"MR. KORESH: Well, like I was telling Jim, you know, I told Jim to, to look into that Bible. I told him to look into Revelation 4 and 5. I told him to look into those seals. Now, if you look at the, the fifth seal, if you look at the sixth seal, if you look into Isaiah 13, if you look in Joel 2, if you look into the back of Nahum, what's fixing to happen has already been foretold. I teach seven seals.  Now, whatever that means, you know, I'd like to talk with you guys in full. I'd like you to grab a Bible, sit down and follow me word by word, see what the ancients have foresaw. And that way we'd have a better understanding.

"MR. KORESH: Okay. The event that you're now fixing to witness is you're fixing to see a government, a government that's been blessed --See, there was an ancient empire called Babylon. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Land of the Chaldeans. And before Babylon ruled the then-known world, God had a people that he brought out of Egypt and God had given them laws and statutes and God had stated unto Israel, which was a cult because they had one leader, Moses, and one right-hand man, Aaron, and God says and promised that if they will keep his laws he'll make them the head of all nations. If they break his laws, he'll scatter them amongst the nations and the nations of the heathens will rule over them. So for many, many hundreds of years God forebores his people. But, finally, the days came when Israel became worse than the heathens. So God arose prophets such as Isaiah, Hosea, Obadiah, Malachi, Zephaniah, Habakkuk, you know, these prophets, Nahum. And God foretold in these prophets how that they'd be scattered amongst the nations. In the Book of Daniel, Daniel was shown, while under the Chaldean captivity, he was shown that the nations of the earth that shall rule over God's people will be symbolized as one great image, and the image will be head of gold, arms of silver, belly of brass, legs of iron, feet part of iron and part of clay. And Daniel says to the king, Nebuchadnezzar, the highest ruling position of the land in that day, Daniel says thou oh, King, of this head of gold, and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and yet a third kingdom of brass.  And then a fourth kingdom, dreadful and terrible, it shall cometh the whole world. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And then there shall be a kingdom that shall be at the ten toes, partly strong and partly broken. So when Rome split up under the nomadic kingdoms, it fell into many different kingdoms. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: We know it as Europe. Now, Daniel goes on to explain that while Europe is still in existence, he goes on to say (indiscernible) behold a stone, came and smote the image in the feet and they had gold and silver and brass and iron, was all made as the chaff of the summer threshing floors. Well, this stone is the subject of which the Book of Revelation talks about. It talks about that which must be hereafter, that God will one day in the future, in the end of the world, shall come and sit on his throne in heaven, and there'll be one question asked in heaven. The question is who is worthy to open this book? The book is in the right hand of God.  And to lose these seven seals thereof, scripture clearly teaches Christendom, that no man in heaven nor on earth neither under earth was able to open and he looked thereon. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But the lamb, the lamb is symbolized as a lamb with seven eyes and seven horns.  You know, God creates things in seven days, doesn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Okay. There's only one many who knows what that book teaches. But for the sake of humanity, the acid test revolving around the subjects in this book revolve around Christ in heaven, opening the seals, and what is witnessed is a man on a white horse, a man on a red horse, black and pale. Dead souls under the altar described to God because of their blood that's been shed, and then the time when the sun and moon and stars will be darkened, the heavens will part as a scroll and the great man, mighty men, free men, bonded men shall cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them and hide them from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb, but the great David's wrath has come. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So these subjects are mysteries, 'cause nobody really has a real thorough opinion to really know the real meanings of these things. But in Chapter 10, after the student of scripture is read and become familiar with the symbols, in Chapter 10, after talking about an army of 200 million that overthrow the world, it talks about a mighty angel coming down from heaven. And he has in his hand a little book and it's opened and seven thunders are uttered, seven thunders. And John was told that when there's time no longer this mystery of God, this revelation of Jesus Christ, the seven seals will be finished, as God has declared to his servants the prophets. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY:  Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So in this 22nd chapter, after a person takes the time to read these things, it's very clear, the statement, Christ says I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David.  Now, Ancient David was a great king, wasn't he? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: He's the one that took his little sling stone and slew the great giant Goliath. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Right. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Yeah, okay. So what happened was he says behold, I come quickly.  My reward is with me, to give it to every man according as his work shall be. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, when Christ comes, the question is going to be what did the father give him that no other man in heaven was worthy to receive? No man was worthy. A book, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: God gave him a book, a revelation of himself that the father claims he's the author of this book. And when the lamb comes, he's going to bring this book and mankind is supposed to find out that it is the Bible, the Bible which the prophets of God having spoken by the spirit that God gave them, having volumed a testament in regards to those events that must be fulfilled in the latter days.  Now, in Revelation 13, John witnesses in regards to the seventh seal, John sees a beast. This beast has a head like a lion, a body like a leopard, feet of a bear. In Daniel 7, Daniel foretold that the empires of Babylon --Persia, Greece and Rome would be symbolized, Babylon as a lion, -_Persia as a bear, Greece as a leopard.  And the fourth beast, he said, would devour all the three beasts before it and conquer the world. Now, that was Rome. Daniel also says in the days of this kingdom they will kill the prince of the covenant. They could change God's times and God's laws and place abomination to make desolate false religion. We know the only true religion is the religion of God. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, Christ died during the times of Rome and on the cross. Very clearly, it's written in the gospel records.  He said father, forgive them for they know not what they do. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And then he said into thy hand I commit my spirit. And the hand of God has a book, the word. By the word of God, God made heaven and earth.  And by his word, there was prophets. The events that you're now witnessing are taking place. Now, what is taking place? Well, in the Book of Micah, it says in that day they shall gather together and they shall say let thine be defiled that they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither do they understand his counsel. All of the prophets through the Book of Nahum, it talks about Messiah, it talks about, well, for instance, to make it real simple, Christ says he has the key of David in revelation.  So in the Book of the Psalms, for instance Psalms 2, David sees a vision of the future, of a confrontation between man and man's law -_",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: --and God and God's law. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, Revelation 13 tells us that there's a lamb-like beast that'll rise up, having two horns, and it'll speak as a dragon. Now, we've got to identify what great empire arose up after Europe that's a great empire that's lamb-like or Christian, but yet doesn't really tell the truth.  Well, the only great empire we've known is the United States of America. Now, back to Psalms 2, the psalm says why do the heathen rage? You know, the heathen don't know God. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"MR. KORESH: Saying let us break his bands asunder. Now, what are the seven bands that Christ promises to bring when he comes again? The seven seals, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: But Zachariah and the other prophets say that the world will not regard these messages of mercy. They have no interest in being instructed by anyone but themselves. Now, they say let us break his bands asunder, let us cast his cords away from us. But scripture says, which is taking place right now, it says that he that sits in the heavens -_That's the father, you see? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: --shall laugh, for the Lord shall have them, the heathen, in confusion. See, the heathen don't know what they're doing. And this time they can't be forgiven because this time they willfully reject the subject which so plainly has been laid in the Book of Revelation, a subject which everyone is to be very familiarized with for the latter days.  And yet, they're to understand by earnest study that these things will remain a mystery until Christ comes again. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
MR. KORESH: To reveal these mysteries. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So the heathen and their tactics in dealing with a person based upon rumors and based upon their laws, they fail to understand that God also has a law and God also has a kingdom and God also has a key. So what takes place, it says, then shall the Lord speak unto them in his wrath. That's what happens during the sixth seal. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: The sun and moon and stars is darkened, the heaven departs as a scroll, and the great men of the earth cry to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the reality that they would not know aforetime what God said will be.  So they end up fulfilling prophecy, not knowing what side they're doing. But to the wise, when God speaks in his wrath, they already know of the events. And it says yet have I set my king up on my holy hill of Zion. So irrespective of what attitude the heathen may take against the truth of the seven seals or the man that is trying to teach the seven seals, irrespective, God's kingdom, the stone, God himself is going to intervene and he's going to hit the image in the feet and it's all going to blow away, and God's going to take the jurisdiction and power from all the great men of the earth and all that the prophets have spoken is to be fulfilled.

HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, the psalm continues to say I will declare the decree, the Lord has said unto me, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. So we know the anointed one is Christ, don't we? Christ is the Son of God in Psalms 2, right? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: And it says the father says to the son ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the earth for thy possession, for thou shalt dash the heathen to pieces with a rod of iron and shall break them as a potter's vessel. Now, that's pretty bad, isn't it? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"MR. KORESH: I mean, nobody wants to be hurt, do they? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: No, really. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: So that's why in Psalms 2 the subject is clear, the mission of the lamb, the anointed one, is to teach the seals, okay? ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
HENRY: Um-hum. ,,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Now, the reason why the prophecy is written is because it continues to say now, therefore, be wise, ye rulers of the world, be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, least he be angry, and ye perish in the way when is wrath is kindled but a little. Now, I'm not mad at you guys, you know. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"HENRY: Well, and we're not mad at you, either. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0
"MR. KORESH: Well, but your show of arms is definitely bigger than my show of arms.  So in Psalms 18, the psalm has made very plain when it says I will love the Lord for he is my rock and my salvation, my buckler and the horn of my salvation. It says I will call upon him so shall I be delivered from my enemies, for they were too strong for me.  And the day of my calamity, and this is a calamity, really, they prevented me. And then it goes on to talk about a terrible event that takes place afterwards, because, you know, you all guys are too big for me. You know, your laws are more numerous than the Ten Commandments, you know, your weapons are bigger, your forces are stronger.",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"MR. KORESH: You know? But not really. You see, not really. You know, Elijah in his day, the king of Israel was having to face the Moabites and the Hittites and they were outnumbered. But what Elijah said was they that be with us are more than they that be with them because unbeknown to the forces of the heathen who were so boistering of their superior power they did not see the invisible forces of God, the angels of God, you know, just like in the days of ancient Hezekiah.

"MR. KORESH: When the Assyrian armies came into Judea, they kept saying to Hezekiah now do not deceive your people, but have all of them come out to me and we'll take you to a land likened to your own and the land flow with milk and honey. Don't let Hezekiah deceive you saying that your God will deliver you. Anyway, what happened was as Hezekiah had listened to the Prophet Isaiah, Hezekiah had repented his sins, asking God for forgiveness. And Hezekiah prayed to God, saying Lord God of heaven, thou art the only true and living God and all the gods of the earth are idols and they are no gods. Now, we've come to the birth and there's no strength to bring forth, so please save us and deliver us that all the world may know that there is a true and living God is Israel. So what took place was, is that that night the angel of the Lord went forth and smote 185,000 of their warriors and they perished.  You see, we all know Christ is coming soon. ",,,,,,,,,,0,0

"MR. KORESH: Okay. But the question is is the world ready for the coming of Christ in glory? Well, God never said he would come in glory the second time. The scriptures tell us, as the Gospel of Peter tells us, look for the salvation that shall be brought to you in the end of the world at the revelation of Jesus Christ. We find in Hebrews Paul tries to explain to the Christian church that we who are of the spirit dwell in the heavenly sanctuary, a sanctuary where the man of this world can never contaminate, they cannot pollute it, they cannot contaminate it, because it revolves around God who speaks through his word, the seven seals.

Psalm 75, Messiah is talking to the, to the heathen and he says I said to the fools do not foolishly, and to the wicked lift not up your horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck, for know that promotion comes neither from the east nor the west nor the south, by the north in Orion --past Orion in heaven in the northern part of the universe, the father has exalted and promoted Christ above all heaven, hasn't he?
