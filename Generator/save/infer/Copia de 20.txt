smart , slick and suspense , that was this
`` better favourite look <UNK>
brilliant .
a fierce crime thriller
close and far away
a true masterpiece .
not not that great
there 's no heart in this <UNK> , but who ever really have been
woof !
enjoyable .
classy old thriller .
indeed ?
one of the best romance movies i 've ever seen
tangled webs
entirely beyond criticism
a horrible thriller that is more like a first step .
intelligent thriller .
extreme dr. phil
average sequel
just about right
the matrix meets goodfellas , via the previous !
sorry sequel of nothing

truth lies inside .
snow angels
piece of work
fits in perfectly
one of the worst
a classic horror movie
the vince <UNK> trio
actually , pretty good
but do not want more screams !
a new kind of behind .
your men are obsolete .
dances with <UNK>
turning japanese .
this movie is a dud .

pleasant but empty ...
what to say ?
largely forgettable entry in this crap !
fight club , thats all never be a better effort
for kids will be kids ...
definition of a powerful godzilla , but a disappointing movie ...

a sequel that keeps the level of the original , take some thing in just another green
a fair adaptation
classic beatles film
oh will the saw it 's just not a perfect nightmare time .
disney 's animation and characters lost in the storm .
good drama with their heads !

disappointing .
boy interrupted
dick tracy dresses like hoa tran
intentionally dirty
electrifying and smart
in the horror line for first

disturbing but fascinating
sleeper hit
shoot to kill the babysitter
less known aspects of everyday life
nothing `` here 's looking at the end .
geeky randy 's summary
it 's a plane !
the acting that ca n't get your hopes up
it was easy my dear .
a blood filled romp
those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life
not for everyone
split decision
marvelous job by marvel again
see quarantine and hard candy instead confused .
have yourself a merry little christmas
sam raimi had the night of the last man pictures
very good science-fiction reboot with some memorable moments and stunning effects .
modern day shakespeare
another the date doctor ...
just great
clever and charged dialog

silly but well done
like watching a delicate rose being smashed over or hate it epic !
very entertaining for the end
imperfect , but fun nonetheless in years .
<UNK> but fascinating
creepy , scary , not looks nice action flick

the best sci-fi movie ever
withstands the tests of time .
an epic in cinematic experience
chicken little , little quality , little too <UNK> for seats
my all-time favorite disney film
impressive job
<UNK> billion dollars !
i do n't care for jack black , i just slightly better

spell-binding !
second chances
`` good holiday comedy '' has no clothes
solid comedy-drama
just about right
the most visually appealing , powerful film of the decade
wonderful but good
visual stunning is a success , but the story was already a shattered mess
too much destruction
an evil house attracts evil men
`` this movie '' is right .
cameron 's earth <UNK>
surprisingly modern
the worst of hitchcock
perfect ?
a torture can epic on effects .
fantastic and very touching sports movie
avatar + 3d glasses = adventure
the scandal : <UNK> <UNK> the same person ?
a proper gritty police thriller with a disappointing conclusion
one great sequel
perfect example of one giant mess of a legendary hollywood series
bit weird
was n't expecting this !
it hurts ...
fun , entertaining thriller from ron howard
do n't get for it - the script does not disappoint
try turning right to go left !
another half-baked film and a seemingly great script ... .

but kinda fun great story
scorsese 's worst .
good not great , not great
the predator arrives in the urban jungle ... ..
<UNK> exquisite ...

monkey do !
a messy yet thrilling historical epic
the tragedy ...
nope .
it 's a wonderful .
8.5/10 .
seen it before , too many !
disjointed and dull
the rest is just details
a gruesome descent
love and other impossible pursuits
rips off a very popular movie
in <UNK> a.d. dragons were a dime a dozen
probably the best , but it 's worth a better film than like this would have shut
epic imperial during china 's tang dynasty spectacular and some on the original film .
i heard bad things , but does okay
geeky randy 's summary
the awful thing about life in silver linings playbook

red eye gets a good review
another great film from steven spielberg and tom hanks .
a fascinating film !
the dialogues , even if you made for <UNK> .
classic comedy
i loved beerfest without the superhero
horror at its best .
father of sci-fi
entertaining , but no masterpiece of realism
delightful and charming
a comedy that is all about the action and in-jokes .
`` there are you '' but ... .
hey horror classic .
an eye opening film !
the most mainstream movie ever
a visual feast , but not the best all series that is very funny
a step down , you can have not see it .
a pleasant movie that i have seen much better car chases
a heist movie without the heist
not your father 's lake house
this is an x-men of a literary but the story is somewhat problematic
slow <UNK>
most over-rated and create as an educational film you have known these characters are unlikeable , it
the too much destruction
family quality cgi , anyway .
not much fun
not as good as the first
regular joe thinks he 's superman .
yada yada yada
beatles compelling attempt superhero movies
all bets are off

great drama with good acting , <UNK> but a dime a oscar film ( dvd )
quaid and connery bond !
beautiful .
an awesome action flick
how to be a very nice sense
an passion of the christ .
scathing film noir

just plain perfect
<UNK> '
fresh , and the dream
on the world and back again
dvd extras actually much potential
i ca n't imagine the render farm this took to make !
fairly bland and jumbled bore
anything goes & comedies
possibly his best .
solid and wonderful performance by cage .
a lot better than given credit for the summer
the worst prison movie
do n't need to be religious
cool but weird .
pretty good
too much destruction
a sadistic triumph but padded in this time when kushner was discovering himself in america .
not see it to believe it will here .
a great war buddy flick
pesci at his best & zombies are almost an distraction ...
totally stupid
very realistic but not that bad
wallace & gromit thriller
great western movie
carnage is just great
the train has left the station
`` looper '' is a pooper ! !
simply awesome .
what an unpleasant `` beautiful piece ( well , if you enjoyed the first two .
