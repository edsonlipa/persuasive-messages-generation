cheesy drama
a campfire story
a very different crime thriller with an flaws left to build the momentum for the avengers
pretty good
perhaps tom hanks ' worst movie .

back to basics of what a ride ...
lazy beyond words
a social commentary ? ...
did we get better with this movie is expected
children 's movie about the subconscious
very underrated !

stunning visuals .
the quiet ones
not the best script ... .

master storytelling
black humor gets along with zombies .
nothing to have a lot
not perfect , but still has a bad film
animals ?
the warren files
pacino is terrific !
an above average cop flick featuring a classic car chase
good effects ?
another remake gone bad
a time low mind .
this movie seems like the main problem with this his head ...
closer to taking a nap .
to sir with <UNK>
why ?
non-stop action and boring
surprisingly entertaining .
good but flawed mess
a mere shadow of its predecessors
a perfect conclusion to the series
disturbing but entertaining
it was panned this one dark
good , but could be it to be happy .
more than just an exploding head !
still smokin ' after all these years !
tasteless humor
one of the major cult movies of the movies , but nonetheless still small again
rather banal love story that needs more hitch directing
forced end fails to satisfy
food for thought
what the heck
aldous snow gets his own movie !
jim carrey 's best year
big disappointment
a good thriller
it 's a must-see .
an excellent , hilarious drama ! ! !
good movie

fast five is a masterpiece and the story
a thought provoking blockbuster !
in a <UNK> daydream
unpretentious and entertaining remake .
that 's hollywoodland as an exciting film deserves no compliments
fairly enjoyable ... ignored at the people are claiming but still great family fun .
a slow burner
disasters of disasters
they want you want to shake your head and demand a rewrite
better than the sequels , very stereotypical of movie .
paradox , delusional narrator commits to dance is only moderate things
a battle for hogwarts
some insecure and do n't come much funner
captivating despite a couple issues
a solid but far from greatness
awful , but not a nice work !
cgi at the end , but the same is the story ?
the war concludes
easily the best animated film
conjured up for this time
revenge .
ring around the collar
a typical action-flick .
three terrific performances but slow tale
the american dream
maligned for no good reason .
surprisingly good , but not that great .
very good .
the war concludes
i am not that happy !
better then the third
you know what ?
implausible holocaust tragic fable .
dark skies
woody rules
most of the year 's worst story .
could have been truly one of 2004 .
abominable immoral ending .
an unpretentious movie of the three <UNK> and action movie
a great remake classic !

good , especially for my most endearing action films and an amazing thriller
superior , atmospheric , twisted , <UNK> ' <UNK> ' , but beautiful work and interesting ,

a nutshell review : alvin and the chipmunks : the motion picture
not impressed !
full marks

well it has the first , but not the worst of the four .
american movie ; highly recommended
a fun movie
i cried
- you want
the lonely death of the man of steel
it swings baby !
a movement !
even you forget about it
where were you listening to the dialog ?
intelligent and enjoyable if you when in rome
too unbelievable twist on the traditional modern romance .
a screwball classic
solidly entertaining , epically huge attempt to the screen
good and bad <UNK> .
best movie ever made 10/10
a sequel that 's a cut above .
brutal , bloody , beautiful , and brilliant
the sound of good performances
i have more to the first , so 's .
not as magical as an awesome as the action , but still very good .
<UNK> out ...
avatar is the visual landmark of our time .
amusing enough second sequel and saw an reality ... <UNK> there 's plot lines , but this
a fascinating effects feast that got me , emotionally resonant , .
maybe sequel to displays 's golden age action flick
an electrifying experience of jim carrey 's
tell every one
great pg13
very enjoyable , `` losers ''
american beauty is all the second sequel of the big screen !
a <UNK> prequel ?
a movie that forever stands the test of time
decent superhero animation

the favorite detective .
a talky adaptation
understated and underplayed
i 'm sold .

<UNK> surreal action picture
watchable biopic
what 's the point is this good ?
flawed gem

the funniest adam sandler movie ever
two names : christopher walken and viggo mortensen ... actually , there 's the more like a
wes craven 's ...
an epic movie .
amazing , gory , and perfect
worth it for mr isaac alone
predictable but hilarious !
absolute genius in one of the best performances
adequate and scary
beautiful drama that plays fast bird .

ok thriller
solid comedy-drama

the bay
beautiful for most <UNK> <UNK> fans only .
eye , there 's got ta work for this you well
equal parts buffy , charmed and x-files , ...
what can i say ?
the imitation game
starts and then a lot of heart .
pathetic dumbed-down comedy
tarantino 's latest reminds audiences of the doubt
looks can be deceiving
a beautiful picture
not worth the watch , but could have been better .
good movie

far too flawed as movie as its as well as highly here
dominic west 's performance is incredible review
stewart is depressed the whole movie .
joe , too , but not really
honestly , nothing else like a guitar case full of guns to use to mount your revenge
light up <UNK> of this most significant
good adaptation of film-making
the best comedy of the 3d
warning excellent jones film !
a visual extravaganza
outstanding effects , clich√©-ridden and lacking originality .
drama overstays its welcome
worth it for the cast , but ...
another breathtaking show , and they are about dead .
hello emptiness
mixed feelings
good for the visuals , but nothing unique .
haunting ...
another marvel delight
worthy sequel .
there goes the neighborhood ...
<UNK> exciting !
not funny , but it 's fun

review : avatar
charles laughton is a powerful , not fun , but is n't for the pan delivers
rousing adventure from hollywood 's best , but its really , ghost rider
the lion is back to roar again .
dune 's devil in my opinion
still great family film .
creepy fun
revolutionary film of our time .
visual stunning
abe <UNK> should have replaced sandra bullock
nothing new
an instant classic .
amusing but overlong
<UNK> , offset , candid
stunning !
quantum leap in cinematic viewing .
not bad but no surprises
finally to bear of something
the money shot ... ...
in the loop
excellent sci-fi
funny but overall below that .
they 're smart ... 8/10
no call
ahh !
fantastic !
not the perfect sci-fi movie
pure filming excellence !
a fantastic finally sci-fi that .
you 've lost the house !
great film , but incredibly slow-paced and lacks story
engaging and perplexing
simply not that bad ...
stirring modern western remake
null and void
a good old and romantic tale !
graphically beautiful , average story
looking at 2013 : the revenge .
a terrific entertainer !
gleefully over-the-top campy , horror hit
upon repeated viewing , grows into another best
r-rated comedy keeps getting <UNK> ... ..
great 3d
lack of creativity
in fact better than tell every way for my low
it 's <UNK> time
hollow sweetness
good movie but too many players
perfect though , with a capital `` k ''
fine production values ... how good they made young # cars men jack west has men ?
well acted , well directed and <UNK>
modern day shakespeare
violent and very <UNK>
saw watching this fine movie
entertaining flick .
good luck yellow haired warrior
<UNK> , <UNK> racism drama
a twilight clone
pretty lousy repeat
methodical brutality
a stunning visual extravaganza
a classic that make .
`` as bad , creepy , hair-raising bug flick . ''
a tale of music & redemption ...
transporting action
what to say , but it was well directed
a modern shakespearean film with a chinese atmosphere
it 's terminator revisited in this life is a film ?
i 'm done .
excellent `` avatar ''
perhaps the worst zombie flick ever made in comedy heaven
royally hilarious .
you wo n't be answering the phone after you 'd endearing
