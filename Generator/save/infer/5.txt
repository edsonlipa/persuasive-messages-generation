outstanding effects light up simple story and the rest just feels like it 's worst
action packed and very worthwhile for much other sci-fi boring -
a tepid dish
the most realistic action film .
a technically accurate translation that misses the <UNK> quirks of family humor on an important human component
powerless against the powerful
tight , yet quite entertaining
artful look at a troubled soul
all <UNK> , no hottie !
a subtle portrait of the birth of your bathroom cabinet
best hollywood reboots ! !

another <UNK> film
formulaic as usual empty where you are missing
favourite cornetto film ! !
within the cabin
my god !
# 2 and still counting
high flying bird
quentin 's first stab at directing ... ... .
tarrantino is a legend !
simply awful and contrived

you must remember this
bad ...
the original and an end of the world
a very british epic
filming the unfilmable
hercules to the <UNK> genre ?
a bad comedy
lovely ... quite hit
doubt is an explosive , intense , riveting , endearing
very sad but excellent independent debut that never feel good motive
a heartbreaking and emotional triumph
we are satisfied
does what was the way around fun , but there were fantastic
perhaps needs to adam sandler the building
when good acting elevates a great plot .
whatever .
not bad
fantastic big screen transfer .
good !
solid animation
zombie makeover movie
tragically lovely
rather watch twilight !
strictly visual feast
a testosterone masterpiece

guilty pleasures
a dark , crazy story that is perfectly in cinematic heaven .
amazing !
not as good as the 1st one
`` oh , god !
`` the price of playing with the power of nature ``
there are no people will be an expert .
sunday bloody sunday
serving the highest
<UNK> , should have shut the door !
it 's terminator revisited in
enjoyable hokum
it 's not tarantino 's best !
defeated the whole purpose of the original 's redemption
too many ingredients in the narrative .
not really necessary i second effort has women ?
often uneven and sometimes breathtaking and gorgeous
sorely underrated
the best parts are so perfect ...
a breakthrough performance with the power of its type
they are the holiday classics ?
bloated feast
what next ?
`` who wants her . ''
this is a metaphor of security obsession
`` i said , where did so much eyes is - this is how you do it
awful thriller with an flaws
better than reloaded
not really .
another dc superhero fails to shine .
fantastic animation is a real horror film ...
an underrated masterpiece !
