two words : absolutely superb thriller .
very impressive
most disappointing films of a cast
pretty good remake of the 1968 romero movies of this decade to kill the babysitter
do you believe in the bell family ?
40 years later still drawing laughs
ok , nothing more
definitely not good enough
deadliest catch
what all movies should be .
originality really missing a certain something ?
methodical brutality
watch on the devil in david me melodrama
a stephen king drama before he was really writing dramas .
what can one man do ?
better than the average movie .
pretty disappointing .
