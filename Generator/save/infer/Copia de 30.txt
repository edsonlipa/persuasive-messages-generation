one of the best `` audition ''
pretty good .
not for everyone , but still fun and exciting .
silly mystery tale
it plays like it more than film-making skill
generic sci-fi classic
horror movie making at this unapologetic and severely dated movie

very impressive
not deep , that made it 's hammer time to be age
make you get what ever made first .
steve mcqueen is bullitt
elizabeth olsen 's big break
scientology riddled mess
not this but it 's quite sorry
do n't bother .
not nearly as villains for down that you can ?
recommended viewing
<UNK> , the paris hilton of the best horror films of the 1990 's

prepared to drop a few iq points ?
the irony
tarantino is a lyrical genius
brilliant crime drama
winner winner
it 's a mess but it lacks more a <UNK> of loose screws
maybe of the moments
mixed feelings
<UNK> !
excellent introduction to the expansive marvel lore
a groundbreaking film of the year .
visually stunning sentimental drivel
engaging mystery
same old dance moves
lots of fake blood ca n't save a very good movie
gripping , yes , the emperor was naked
refund worthy
the best of the matrix movies
pass to put it
the bad path is a circle
educational and courageous
pretty good
works mainly because of the wrong time !
french missing
a good movie to waste time watching
good fun , but with a sense of emptiness
better-than-anticipated popcorn crowd-pleaser big-screen actioner
no frills basic scary movie
no funny , goofy , <UNK>
spectacular finish
interesting , mainly because of an important and powerful
another <UNK> film
an empty visually no kubrick 's better book than ever had .
overly reserved
an excellent , unforgettable crime drama
heaven goes to <UNK> in amusing humour ''
long , very long , but worth every penny
woof !
a unique work of film art
great animation , good characters , not to be `` <UNK> '' !
laugh ... here ? ?
music lovers , this one .
good actors + poor direction
2011 's sleeper hit
totally awesome !
a devastating character study ; only an animated apocalypse
not as horrible as as bad as everyone says is spooky , but disappointing .

a nutshell review : the losers
fascinating .
a good horror/comedy film , but interesting
war of words
two words : absolutely superb
disney 's flawed but has the cgi !
the 40 year old virgin is naughty fun
a good buzz !
thrilling boring story about teenagers during the 60 's
cast fit the characters perfectly in quentin tarantinos directorial debut , but maybe not exactly the lord
this type of thing 's redemption
when it came out ...
worth films
you definitely wo n't this found footage genre die hard
another and enjoyable if you can do n't get the <UNK> , will hate the devil in
how to say they , this movie really .
