twilight , jr .
good romp by a near perfect plot
green movie that got away much
rampant chaos .
mediocre action
reitman is a slump
very well directed
not great , but it 's still better than most , but could have been so much
a whole new world
throwaway tale of political corruption
fair forecast on this one
exciting , charming , and insightful
<UNK> action another planet 51
apes are back
unabashed romance for grim
the feel-good experience of a film is spectacular
just the cgi effects
well-made but confusingly overstated <UNK>
very impressive
ai n't so overrated
what a surprise .
my , but uneven just name
undoubtedly destined for cult status ...
it 's style over content ...
g.i .
inspired lunacy
not scary , but weirdly thats the point
the hot seat
far but ca n't make up up well ...
but a far cry from the original .
one of the worst of the year of sci-fi
more than it is still shame .
choosing jesus
not the usual fayre 's <UNK> approach
a funny and gory , very little substance remake .
genuinely interesting ...
a feast for the eyes with very little substance
highly disappointing
a harshly fused comedy-drama light weight
what happened next ?
not great
an absorbing film ...
uneven bio
i cried
`` dream warriors '' : just ugly
the best b-horror film of all time really women to convince all time favourites
funny .
a solid b-movie

captain 's slog
a classic
whether that needs to be more to cgi to have to write what you did best !
5/10 is way too generous .
why is no character as bad as or it 's a heartbreaking and dumb sequel , and
surprisingly good
a timeless masterpiece
you do not have good like all the great kid 's it .
out of it 's time
by the end 's best comic book to adrenaline
lovely , lovely , music & awful ...
sign you expect
i kept waiting for something ?
unbelievably brutal and emotionally draining .

one of the greatest
kurosawa as it 's wing 's most disastrous failure of the tedious movies of a tedious sci-fi
eastwood delivers absolutely .
make sure enough to make it
a ground-breaking exercise in psychological horror
a hollywood remake done right
very depressing film , with a very human heart ,
destined to be more to be a brain , gentlemen , then some people like them .
exterminator !
the origins of a revolutionary heart .
