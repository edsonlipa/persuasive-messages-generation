perfect !
one all time holiday special
uninteresting
a simian army terrorizes san francisco .
marvel does it again
what 's the gripe , exactly the first stab at directing ...
billion dollar baby
shepard overdose
modern masterpiece
a perfect journey to dvd movie
darkly perfect
flawed but interesting
who 's afraid of a start ... .
great conclusion to a fantastic trilogy ,
it 's a entertaining and better than the first
an instant classic
hero 's transformation in `` avatar ''
predictable and ludicrous
eerily prophetic
