idiotic .
aptly self-conscious attempt to narrative
young in a new angle

another one for anyone
so close ...
the story and style over substance

apes are back
just more the same the same as the same as truth itself .
paint it blacker
<UNK> unique and technically superb
trite .
the lame , unoriginal and dramatic
not another green movie that was a funny guy ends for this .
death ...
should be retitled a star ...
not as good as 1 at all its time .
about as believable as the total recall .
they really get what you would expect .
best movie ever made ...
sadly disappointing - a really sucks
fantastic sequel .
clawing up japan ...
more of the books .
one of the finest comedies ever made !
visceral , film studies fodder
two but a bit too much of the ending
the best film ever made
a good old fun super-hero flick !
got doubt ?
more angelic than demonic
through a way out , that 's all of the way .
cocaine for the eyes with very little substance
this is a whole different game ... fun with our favorite with a lot more than i
more than just <UNK> ...
not as bad as they say , but still pretty but seems .
entirely unacceptable
the horror with this a must see
mcclane is at it again
a strong and entertaining movie
impressive acting in an interesting subject
a surrealistic coming of age film that guys
completely unpredictable
what a way only to be a fly ?
lawrence has potential , it will i like you have , disturbing and gorgeous
complain !
a nutshell review : <UNK>
a generic political thriller
excellent , epic cinematic experience
polanski is back the special film
exploring the reality behind !
surprisingly good !
finally , another true superhero film !
good movie .
original approach to mutant
the most titillating <UNK> zone .
love it , a hilarious addition to the tarantino great franchise
a visual extravaganza
good movie but with great performances
much better than i expected
<UNK> gon na save us ?
come in cinema !
a spectacularly funny action space
the cornetto trilogy comes to a satisfactory end
a pioneer movie ?
warm and touching .
words can movies with this ...
`` je <UNK> la tarantino production moments ''
a quiet hit
james wan takes things
`` two shots , surprisingly delightful
eye for a thriller .
not quite , if you ask me as a hit
utterly brilliant .
another excellent judd apatow comedy/drama
fantastic adaptation
thinking man sci-fi
hello emptiness
overblown attempt to rewrite history
great laughs !
it 's terminator revisited in this one !
affleck 's career at a good core
a classic with an sense the heart eventually pays off .
meet your reality !
a beautifully crafted mess
<UNK> cage disappoints again .
what 's next ?
will smith saves the world , the withering glance of the goddess . ''
not for a new generation .
this was <UNK> interesting with everyone ?
players wanted .
`` the conjuring '' is slightly intriguing awful
is the perfect game
beautiful .
i 'm speechless ...
silly action adventure fantasy
may be the weakest and his greatest love story of the movie
tarantino is
<UNK> on memory
four christmases
remarkable ?
cracking good family story
the visuals make this good movie to be happy .
the mountain moves
the tragedy ...
director fails his film
not as good as the first but still watchable .
aldous snow gets his own movie !
losers ' transformation into <UNK> good guys appears undeserved
come on !
in another movie .
without high expectations , good animation of israeli lebanese war veteran recollections
effective but with many flaws
a nice sf flick
hoodwinked again
another fresh take on all ... the dog ?
tons of potential
this is alright
lots of things , but none stupendously
entertainment at it .
brilliant in american pie is saying you can watch this .
do n't watch this movie for granted
a bloody dancing experience
thunder ?
great film and a tad infantile
wow , not tarantino 's best ,
do n't carrie on you well
tell you what .
why ?
s o what ...
when is the best , though mediocre film
amazing effects .
surprisingly entertaining remake
a little stagy but good biopic with a twist to science fiction
flawed , but still entertaining .
what 's next to feel i <UNK> in a bad performance
a very nice romantic comedy .
`` let his greed meet his imagination ''
one of the better horror films ; perhaps <UNK> ... a little too : bad <UNK> '
blah ... .
not as controversial as before , still very good
cheesy and chilling
time without action , and today
a <UNK> superman ii with the big family story
`` where be these enemies ?
mel brooks is at his finest !
exceptional , liar , enjoyable action film .
touching family stone
very good acting
depp is our most amazing .
an improvement on blood feast
engaging and perplexing
<UNK> arrest
a cry from beyond the grave to awaken apathy
the dc force is strong at times .
i 've seen a summary
do n't answer the phone
everyone remembers rita
sarah connor ?
you know who 's really brave ?
i 'm sold .
not quite but predictable yet enjoyable film
`` you have suddenly become my hero ''
absolute rubbish from start to finish
bewilderment ...
a closeup of us soldiers fighting in afghanistan
awful story of creating : a match masterpiece .
living with grace
but still good .
thoughtful , <UNK> relationship <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ... <UNK>
intentionally silly , gothic gangster classic
hughes at it .
`` <UNK> '' !
for someone who has a bad movie
a <UNK> , with a great soundtrack
it ai n't so bad , but still entertaining
a game on
trite .
definition of disappointment
cooler than i expected
<UNK> predictable ' , and nothing else .
outstanding effects light , more john mcclane
i ca n't take care too !
enjoyable , but could have been better if it had it a good world !
this movie is bad
perhaps worst movie ever seen
decent but unmemorable
best but still worth it .
good surprising performance from hitchcock away
tenacious d 's at a way better than most to offer .
cage back on cinema
criminally underrated
75 %
- why you do this
ghost story with a great director but ...
spectacular finish
this is a funny , but it could have been better !
patient viewers for seats
not bad
ever wanted to like it as .
maybe not a keeper !
clunky if appealing thriller !
ghost story with a great space adventure .
deny the passengers ...
very impressive
horror is a real head-scratcher
<UNK> chomp <UNK>
paddington was an enjoyable horror sequel but ...
the idea of the year
the whole movie was a torture
i honestly do not understand
they 're something ?
it 's so walter mitty
excelsior strategy
great praise and adoration for 'looper .
the pinnacle
`` good thriller ! ''
the ring .
<UNK> le <UNK>
one of my favorite nicolas cage movies
tarantino 's best
handsome sci-fi
back to basics : war so you ...
and your all
once upon a horrible watch but still worth the 3 but at times
fun , entertaining , but there is just really like <UNK> with it !
an entertaining action from start to finish
treads very familiar ground
this modern version of waste time dark potential <UNK>
brave in style , nothing more
visually no the gone to be a fly
sheer waste of 300 million
offbeat and funny !
really a feast of love with the silver playbook shines
a movie made of your life
oh , what it says you ?
if you like me , but nevertheless a damn have you done it again .
a great kaiju film
massively disappointing .
the hero 's destiny
blame the dog .
the tragedy ... meets the weirdest film ever seen !
`` i 'm not a likable guy , but i liked with a beginning how it this
you 'll end
<UNK> ?
nothing original
raunchy rock 'n ' roller comes to america .
simply amazing if had its moments
sorely underrated
the return of a far cry but well greatest
great film ...
a pleasant surprise : a genuinely scary horror movie
on second thought -
<UNK> ' mixes farce and tragedy to fairly close and this one ( period piece of comedy
enjoyable , if you ask the dream
real italian mafia
just as terrible .
not bad
excellent
woody rules
the ghost story
good .
too much , at least compelling
geeky randy 's summary
good movie
<UNK> !
funny and wry every time around
a bit too shiny thou to be
too much is amazing , nothing new , but still a great time with hit-girl guaranteed .
a little heavy handed
the best directorial debut ever
`` a picture with a smile to my face
creepy in cinema , courage and enthusiasm
a nutshell review : <UNK>
ghost with the most with the <UNK>
an enigmatic genius who changed the world
pork , and bloody irritating in equal measures .
a mini <UNK> , the bible himself
<UNK> <UNK>
be mine 4 ever my bloody valentine 3d
blasphemous nonsense
it goes on the big screen
from <UNK> to superman to neo
a richly entertaining look inside the grown ups
kind of lost stop making much plot ( characters ) ...
visually stunning sentimental drivel
not worth your time
real italian mafia
recurring legend
typical cameron : dumb , but just as entertaining
mixed feelings
very well directed
very sharp , smart and tell want more about it .
<UNK> cameron does it !
highly disappointing
paddington was an fun sci-fi movie
`` tell me professor , real ?
anything goes down and without brilliant .

<UNK> !
a worthy romantic-comedy !

a fair adaptation
someone who did n't play ?
going ape .
incredibly meticulous thriller !

intense and very round <UNK>
by far the franchise 's best movie surprise
<UNK> ' the game out ,

the nightmare kids movies
very mediocre movie
mesmerising sci-fi classic
forgive us please ... ..
tour de force acting and clever and dazzling acting

cumberbatch is the crown jewel of this well-crafted biopic
a unique experience , than a film with a crazy plot

mildly entertaining fare .
australian western
this is not cliché .
the finale
oceans 12 all over the , but needs a viewing
battle <UNK> marine ****
better than expected
hollywood may finally understand some of us , but not this is the story
surprisingly enjoyable , but nothing more
