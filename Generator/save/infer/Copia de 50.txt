works for <UNK>
simply amazing animation genius
the top almost `` <UNK> production but mildly by its own rights
graphic excellence mounted on <UNK> thin plot .
brad pitt is simply outstanding
bates does it again
a perfect depiction of great decade
expensive mumbo jumbo <UNK>
best film adaptation of the remake is admirable but overwhelming
absolutely epic
nine in the afternoon
from bad nic cage ...
i 'm not a fan of cgi 's most violent films of hollywood
pro : fighting robots
no rhythm at this movie
another atrocious `` comedy '' starring sandler
should please the horror express ...
class ( y ) - i just how satisfying to make if we actually
`` here 's looking at you , kid . ''
the green mess
pretty disappointing .
one of the most over-rated `` b movie .
nothing more
an underrated masterpiece .
a class act ...
beavis & butthead score !
not smart enough to succeed or death an awesome , but there .
nothing new here
predictable story and disappointing work
maybe <UNK> lacks romantic comedy
animated hell of age .
things just happen .
maybe a bit more polishing ...
no rhythm at this ...
monkey see monkey do
not good , but lugosi is missing

pilot review
stunning movie i 've seen in ages
another unnecessary remake
crank is a whole way no review : avatar
same old dance moves
i dream plot lines better than this
powerful film in the decade .
probably one of the most compelling sequels ever bombs
a good third chapter
i expected too like no other
an above-average airline thriller
a satisfactory sequel
hopkins is hitchcock
a very boring experience
waltz of death
good movie .
fast and exciting .
fine mystery tale
it to liebesman
tried to recreate the action films 's just around ... again ...
a brilliant film
not a masterpiece movie for everyone .
a shoddy script by hollywood <UNK>
tight , sharp .
ah sammy jackson , one of the most male centered movies i have ever seen
inspired silliness and pretty of the crap , but ...
funny and then some .
as the crowe flies
that 's entertainment
i guess .
strong message , pretty comedy like transformers . with very believable sequel
solid , sizzling superhero movie
bros before comedy !
pleasant but does not very memorable revenge
a nutshell review : avatar
truly sumptuous !
the key and not disappointing effort
by far that is one of the indiana jones films of all time
