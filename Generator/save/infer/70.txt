predictably spectacular ... spectacularly meets zombies are too lovely
another performance capture from zemeckis
it 's true to be
entertaining

not the greatest fantasy adventure
an auspicious debut ...
better than the first film
you have to appreciate it very funny at times
eerily prophetic ...
superficial treatment of a major figure in his kind
slick and clinical exercise
great performance by kurt russell
unexpectedly funny
a satisfying way to spend a spell on fire breathing dragons `` green lantern ''
`` as good as a killer climax
the most underrated thriller
a classy action film
implausible plot
what an unpleasant movie
garbage , but not really bad
better than the first
wolverine <UNK>

not frightening , pure but not very satisfactory
wild and deep adaptation
it had potential , <UNK> in my opinion
shaky-cam shocker that has it 's moments
