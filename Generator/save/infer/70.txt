an auspicious debut ...
better than the first film
you have to appreciate it very funny at times
eerily prophetic ...
superficial treatment of a major figure in his kind
slick and clinical exercise
great performance by kurt russell
unexpectedly funny
a satisfying way to spend a spell on fire breathing dragons `` green lantern ''
