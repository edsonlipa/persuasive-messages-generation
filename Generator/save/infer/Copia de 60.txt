as an educational and the movie .
realism colors this creature feature
not bad , but the second one day saw the series
the age of original ...
moments of film noir
much better than the da vinci code .
thoughtless theatrical story of a scary real-life disaster
bad and heartwarming .
could do n't fool this movie this is that too .
great cast + compelling plot
a compelling film that is simply a fun ride .
another biopic powered by a acting
