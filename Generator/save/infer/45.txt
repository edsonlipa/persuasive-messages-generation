absolutely engrossing but uneven
middle -- terrible acting , and a boy .
the weak link of the series
interesting adaption
'the future ' feels the flaws
the preview 's tricky caper
where , the my and why i be of the first movie
a cliche is appropriate - this - the best is about writers you else will you .
good movie !
the best of time & the worst story of all time

this is not a movie , but a classic
good fun
disappointing sequel
highly disappointing
impressive and interesting piece of film-making
